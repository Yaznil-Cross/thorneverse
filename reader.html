<p>Half-empty bottle of cheap red wine breathing on the counter, the kind Mateo bought from the corner store when he was feeling sorry for himself. Stack of unpaid bills next to the pepper shaker &quot;”&quot; electric, water, the credit card she&#x27;d told him to stop using. And in the center, spread out like a war map, the schematics for the East End Lofts. Mateo&#x27;s head was buried in his forearms on top of them, hiding the load-bearing calculations with his breakdown.</p>
<p>The fluorescent light above the sink buzzed. It had been buzzing for three weeks. She&#x27;d asked him to fix it twice.</p>
<p>Sasha stood by the sink, her hand gripping the granite so hard her knuckles went ashy. The cold of the stone seeped into her palm, grounding her, keeping her present when everything in her wanted to float away. She wasn&#x27;t crying. Architects don&#x27;t cry when buildings fall. They analyze the debris. They calculate what can be salvaged. They figure out who&#x27;s going to pay.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s bad, Sash.&quot; His voice came out wet, muffled by his sleeves. She could smell him from here &quot;”&quot; that sour, metallic fear-sweat he got when things went wrong. Not the clean sweat of work. The rancid sweat of panic. &quot;The lawyer said if they trace the cut corners back to me &quot;”&quot; criminal negligence. Twenty years. Mandatory minimum.&quot;</p>

<p>But that was the thing about crisis. The mind went sideways. Grabbed onto small details because the big picture was too heavy to hold.</p>
<p>Marcus Webb. Forty-three years old. Father of two. Iron worker for sixteen years without a single incident. Now he&#x27;d never walk again because Mateo Rivera decided to pocket the difference between grade-60 and grade-40 steel.</p>
<p>&quot;They won&#x27;t trace it to you,&quot; she said. Her voice sounded like it was coming from another room. Like someone else was speaking through her mouth while she watched from somewhere far away.</p>
<p>Mateo looked up. Face a mess of snot and terror, eyes red-rimmed and swollen. He&#x27;d been crying for hours &quot;”&quot; she could tell by the puffiness, by the raw skin around his nostrils where he&#x27;d been wiping. He looked like a child who&#x27;d broken something expensive and was waiting to find out how bad the punishment would be.</p>
<p>&quot;How can you know that?&quot; Hope crept into his voice. Desperate, grasping hope. &quot;I signed the purchase order. My name is on the steel delivery. The invoice has my signature, Sash. MY signature.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha walked to the table. Her bare feet were silent on the tile &quot;”&quot; cold tile, always cold, because he kept the thermostat too low to save money he spent on weed and takeout instead. She picked up her red pen from the cup by the phone. The one she used for grading junior architects&#x27; work. For correcting blueprints. For fixing other people&#x27;s mistakes.</p>

<p>She&#x27;d done the math. Twenty-eight years of data. Twenty-eight years of being the strong one, the fixer, the one who held the sky up so everyone else could walk around underneath it without worrying about whether it might fall. Her mother had taught her that. <em>You&#x27;re the oldest, Sasha. You set the example.</em> Her grandmother had reinforced it. <em>Our women carry. That&#x27;s what we do. We carry until we can&#x27;t, and then we carry some more.</em></p>
<p>She&#x27;d carried her brother through his addiction. Carried her mother through the divorce. Carried her father&#x27;s disappointment when she chose architecture over medicine.</p>

<p>She didn&#x27;t kiss him back. Didn&#x27;t say it back. Just stared at the red pen in her hand, the cap still off, wondering why saving him felt exactly like drowning.</p>

<p>Hades Thorne didn&#x27;t just fill the frame &quot;”&quot; he blotted out the sun. Six-four of black wool and inevitability, dark shoulders so broad they seemed to press against both sides of the doorway.

It came from something else. Something older and more dangerous.</p>
<p>He looked less like a parole officer and more like a reaper who&#x27;d come to collect on a debt that had been compounding interest for years.</p>

Made her look twice, then look away, then look back again like she couldn&#x27;t help herself.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t care.&quot;</p>
<p>Three words. That&#x27;s all it took to stop her mid-sentence. She was a licensed architect who&#x27;d presented to boardrooms full of men twice her age.

<p>Sasha&#x27;s mouth opened. To protest. To ask what the fuck he thought he was doing. To tell him that she was a grown woman in her own home and she didn&#x27;t kneel for anyone.</p>
<p>Her knees hit the rug.</p>
<p>She didn&#x27;t remember making the decision. Didn&#x27;t remember her legs bending, her body lowering. One moment she was standing, and the next she was on the floor, the Persian wool soft against her bare knees where her skirt had ridden up.</p>` },

<p>&quot;Brace it anyway,&quot; Sasha called back, marking something on her clipboard. &quot;I don&#x27;t trust those joints. Original mortar&#x27;s been compromised for decades. One bad vibration and we&#x27;re looking at a collapse.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Nothing falls</em>, she thought, watching two workers haul the bracing into position. <em>Not on my site. Not on my watch.</em></p>

<p>He adds the second finger.</p>
<p>My mouth falls open. No sound comes out. Just &quot;”&quot; nothing. Brain empty. The stretch is too much, my body trying to accommodate two thick fingers in a hole that&#x27;s never held anything.</p>
<p>&quot;There it is.&quot; He watches my face in the mirror. &quot;That&#x27;s the look. That&#x27;s what I wanted to see.&quot;</p>
<p>He starts moving.</p>
<p>Slow at first. Pulling out until just his fingertips stay inside, then pushing back in with a drag that makes my toes curl in my heels. I can feel every ridge of his knuckles. Every millimeter of movement.</p>

I found this little restaurant in Barcelona, right on the water. I wanna take you there. Just sit and watch the sunset and&quot;”&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Hades reaches around with his free hand. Finds my nipple through the silk. Pinches. Hard.</p>

<p>The restored ceiling soared above her &quot;”&quot; her ceiling, her work, two years of fighting with contractors and historic preservation boards and her own perfectionism &quot;”&quot; and she couldn&#x27;t see any of it. Couldn&#x27;t see anything except the faces that weren&#x27;t his.</p>
<p>Gold dress. No panties. Just like he said.</p>
<p>Every step she&#x27;d taken tonight, the silk had kissed her bare pussy. Every time she shifted her weight, she&#x27;d felt the air. The vulnerability. The readiness. She&#x27;d walked through crowds of donors and board members with nothing between her cunt and a thousand-dollar dress, and no one knew. No one except him.</p>
<p>Except he wasn&#x27;t here.</p>` },
    { chapter: 1, title: ``, content: `<p>She&#x27;d given her speech. Stood on that podium with the lights blinding her and three hundred people applauding, talking about restoration and preservation and honoring the bones of buildings that had stood for a century. Her voice had been steady. Professional. Sasha Williams, Senior Restoration Architect, the woman who saved Sterling Library. And the whole time, her naked cunt had throbbed under her dress, and she&#x27;d scanned the back of the room for a shadow that never materialized.</p>
<p>&quot;The restoration is breathtaking,&quot; Mrs. Vanderbilt gushed, appearing at her elbow with a champagne flute and a smile full of too-white veneers. &quot;You saved this building, dear. Truly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It had good bones.&quot; The words came out on autopilot. Architect voice. Gala voice. The voice she&#x27;d perfected over a decade of these events. &quot;The original architect knew what he was doing. I just... honored his vision.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So modest!&quot; Mrs. Vanderbilt patted her arm with a hand dripping in diamonds. &quot;You must be so proud.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Proud.</em></p>
<p>Sasha smiled. Nodded. Made the right sounds while her eyes kept moving. Kept searching.</p>
<p>The black SUV had been at the curb when her Uber dropped her off. She&#x27;d seen it. Idling. Waiting. Her heart had slammed against her ribs so hard she&#x27;d thought she might pass out before she made it to the door.</p>
<p>But he hadn&#x27;t come inside.</p>
<p>An hour passed. Then two.</p>
<p>She made small talk with donors. Accepted compliments on the crown molding. Explained the challenges of matching century-old plaster to a man who clearly didn&#x27;t care but wanted to seem cultured. She did everything right &quot;”&quot; everything she was supposed to do &quot;”&quot; while the wet heat between her legs slowly cooled and the anticipation curdled into something else.</p>
<p><em>Where is he.</em></p>
<p>She checked her phone. Nothing.</p>` },
    { chapter: 1, title: ``, content: `<p><em>He told me to be here. He told me what to wear. He&quot;”&quot;</em></p>
<p>She excused herself from a conversation about tax-deductible donations and found an empty corner near the bar. The jazz band was playing something slow. Couples swayed on the dance floor &quot;”&quot; old money and their trophy wives, moving to rhythms they&#x27;d learned at cotillion.</p>
<p>Sasha watched them. Felt the gold silk against her bare thighs. Felt the absence of his hands like a phantom limb.</p>
<p><em>I&#x27;m standing in a room full of people, dressed like a present waiting to be unwrapped, and he&#x27;s not even going to open me.</em></p>
<p>The realization didn&#x27;t bring relief.</p>
<p>It brought something worse &quot;”&quot; a cold, sinking humiliation that settled in her gut like concrete setting in a foundation she&#x27;d poured wrong. The kind of mistake you couldn&#x27;t fix once it hardened. The kind that meant tearing everything down and starting over.</p>
<p><em>Why am I still here?</em></p>
<p>She could&#x27;ve left an hour ago. Gone home to Mateo. Put on sweats and pretended this night never happened. Pretended she hadn&#x27;t spent forty-five minutes getting ready, hadn&#x27;t stood naked in front of her mirror wondering if the gold dress made her ass look good enough, hadn&#x27;t thought about what he might do to her while she lined her eyes and glossed her lips.</p>
<p>Instead she was standing in a room full of strangers, bare under her designer dress, wet for a man who didn&#x27;t bother to show up.</p>
<p><em>I&#x27;m disappointed</em>, she realized, and the thought hit her like a slap. Like his palm across her cheek last night in that marble bathroom. <em>He didn&#x27;t come to use me and I&#x27;m disappointed.</em></p>
<p>That was the crack in the foundation. The stress fracture she couldn&#x27;t plaster over.</p>` },

Every fantasy of what he might do &quot;”&quot; pull her into a supply closet, bend her over a display case, fuck her in front of the Vanderbilts and their champagne.</p>

<p><em>That&#x27;s some sick shit. And I&#x27;m the one who&#x27;s sick for wanting it.</em></p>

<p>Sasha walked to the valet stand on autopilot, arms wrapped around herself against the night chill. The December air bit through the thin silk of her dress, found her bare skin underneath, made her dark nipples harden against the fabric.</p>
<p>The cold didn&#x27;t feel like his breath anymore. It just felt cold.</p>
<p>She gave the valet her ticket. Waited. Watched her breath fog in the air.</p>
<p>The black SUV was gone. The curb was empty. Just taxis and town cars ferrying drunk donors back to their brownstones.</p>
<p>Her car arrived. She got in. Sat there for a moment with her hands on the wheel, not turning the key.</p>
<p>She looked down at the gold dress that had felt so dangerous three hours ago.</p>` },

<p><em>What does that make me?</em></p>
<p>She didn&#x27;t have an answer. The city lights blurred past her windows, and she drove home to a man who loved her, feeling more alone than she&#x27;d ever felt in her life.</p>` },

<p>Day 5.</p>
<p>Drafting table. Morning sun cutting through the blinds. Coffee Mateo had made her ---</p>
<p>hazelnut, two sugars, exactly how she liked it. He&#x27;d left a note on the mug: Love you. Have</p>
<p>a good day. ---T</p>

<p>The job site. West Wing almost finished now, the corner where he&#x27;d fingered her</p>

<p>Drove for twenty minutes without knowing where she was going. Letting the city blur past</p>

<p>Until -- where her subconscious had taken her.</p>
<p>The Parole Office. 10 PM. Building dark. Parking lot empty.</p>

<p>something crack open in her chest.</p>
<p>The light was impossible. Stained glass panels transformed the afternoon sun into rivers of</p>

<p>made visible. The columns themselves rose like trees, branching at the top into a canopy</p>

<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a lot.&quot; Mateo&#x27;s voice beside her. Soft. Reverent. &quot;Makes you feel small, huh?-- It makes me feel held,&quot; she corrected. Her voice came out distant, like it belonged to</p>

<p>stone shifts, the whole system responds. But it holds.&quot;</p>
<p>Like me. I&#x27;ve been holding all this tension, all this weight, and I haven&#x27;t collapsed yet.</p>

<p>probably violated half a dozen health codes. They&#x27;d found it by accident --- wandered down</p>
<p>a side street looking for tapas and followed the sound of heels striking wood.</p>
<p>The dancer came out, and Sasha&#x27;s breath stopped.</p>
<p>She wasn&#x27;t young. Wasn&#x27;t pretty in any conventional way. She was fierce. Face twisted in</p>
<p>an expression that looked like rage or ecstasy or both. Her heels hit the floorboards like</p>
<p>gunshots --- clack clack clack --- each strike sending vibrations through the room.</p>
<p>The guitarist played something violent. The male dancer entered, grabbed the woman&#x27;s</p>

<p>surrendered to his grip even as her face remained defiant. The way they moved like two</p>
<p>people who knew exactly how hard they could push each other.</p>

<p>He stepped forward. Pointed a finger at Hades&#x27; chest. The universal gesture of a man who&#x27;d</p>
<p>watched too many movies and didn&#x27;t understand what he was dealing with.</p>

<p>was pulling something dark over his face --- a ski mask. Making himself</p>
<p>anonymous. Making this look like something it wasn&#x27;t.</p>

<p>Two more blows. Quick. Efficient. Mateo curled into a ball, trying to protect his head, but</p>
<p>Hades wasn&#x27;t aiming for his head. He was aiming for soft tissue. Places that would hurt but</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t kill.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s not trying to murder him. He&#x27;s sending a message.</p>

<p>&quot;I know. I&#x27;m sorry. It&#x27;s been\\... a lot.-- A lot?&quot; Lisa&#x27;s voice sharpened. &quot;Sash, you showed up at my house Tuesday night looking</p>
<p>like you got dragged behind a truck. You cried in my bathroom for an hour. You borrowed</p>
<p>my clothes because yours were\\... I don&#x27;t even know what was on your clothes. And then</p>
<p>you just ghost me for two days?&quot;</p>
<p>Cum. That&#x27;s what was on my clothes. And spit. And sweat. And frozen dirt.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m dealing with it,&quot; Sasha said. &quot;I promise. I just need some time.&quot;</p>
<p>Silence on the other end. Then: &quot;Is this about that man? The one you said you were</p>
<p>seeing?&quot;</p>` },

<p>tie myself to a tree and fuck my ass in the dirt.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s complicated.-- Sash.&quot; Lisa&#x27;s voice went soft. That was worse than the anger. &quot;Baby, you gotta talk to me.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m your girl. I been your girl since Howard. Whatever this is, we can figure it out together.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha felt the tears building. Swallowed them down.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t tell you. I can&#x27;t tell anyone. Because if I say it out loud, I&#x27;ma have to admit what I am.</p>
<p>And I ain&#x27;t ready for that.</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I know you my girl. Just\\... give me a minute, okay? I&#x27;ma be</p>
<p>alright.-- You better be.&quot; Lisa paused. &quot;And Sash? Whatever you doing with this man? Be careful.</p>
<p>You ain&#x27;t the type to lose yourself over some dick. But you looking real lost right now.&quot;</p>
<p>Too late.</p>
<p>&quot;I hear you,&quot; Sasha said. &quot;I&#x27;ll call you later.&quot;</p>
<p>She hung up. Stared at the construction site through the windshield.</p>
<p>I ain&#x27;t the type to lose yourself over some dick.</p>
<p>She used to believe that. Used to pride herself on it. Men came and went but Sasha</p>
<p>Williams stayed solid. Focused. In control.</p>
<p>Then he walked into my living room and told me to kneel.</p>
<p>And I did.</p>
<p>And I liked it.</p>
<p>She got out of the car. Squared her shoulders. Put on the mask.</p>
<p>Time to be Ms. Williams again.</p>
<p>Monday.</p>
<p>A courier arrived at her office just after lunch. Brown paper package, no return address.</p>
<p>Sasha signed for it without thinking. Probably materials from a vendor. Fabric samples for</p>
<p>the curtain restoration.</p>
<p>She tore it open at her desk.</p>
<p>Inside was a book. Heavy. Hardcover. Black dust jacket with white text.</p>` },

<p>She opened the front cover. Something slipped out --- a stiff rectangle of paper caught</p>
<p>between the pages.</p>
<p>Not paper. Glossy. A photograph.</p>
<p>A Polaroid.</p>
<p>Sasha&#x27;s blood went cold.</p>
<p>The image was grainy. Black and white. Shot from behind, lit by what looked like car</p>
<p>headlights.</p>
<p>A clearing in the woods. A woman standing --- no, SUSPENDED --- from a tree branch.</p>
<p>Naked. Blindfolded. Back arched violently, spine curved to breaking, ass thrust out like an</p>
<p>offering to something ancient and hungry.</p>
<p>Her hands were tied above her head. Her thighs were slick with something wet. Her locs</p>
<p>hung wild around her face.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s me.</p>
<p>The realization hit her like a punch to the chest.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s me in the woods. He took a picture. While I was blindfolded. While I couldn&#x27;t see.</p>
<p>He has proof.</p>
<p>Her phone buzzed.</p>
<p>Unknown Number: Study the lines, Sasha. Structure is everything.</p>
<p>She shoved the Polaroid back into the book. Slammed it shut. Looked around the office to</p>
<p>see if anyone had noticed her hands shaking.</p>
<p>Miller was at the far end of the room, arguing with a subcontractor about tile spacing.</p>
<p>Nobody was looking at her.</p>
<p>He was there. The whole time. Watching. Recording.</p>
<p>And I didn&#x27;t even know.</p>
<p>She should be terrified. She should feel violated. Exposed.</p>
<p>She felt seen.</p>
<p>This nigga really out here treating me like a project. Studying my lines. Measuring my load-</p>
<p>bearing capacity.</p>
<p>Architect recognizing architect.</p>
<p>She tucked the book into her bag. Kept her face neutral. Went back to reviewing blueprints</p>
<p>like her whole world hadn&#x27;t just shifted on its foundation.</p>
<p>But underneath the desk, her thighs pressed together. The familiar pulse</p>
<p>between her legs --- the one that said more.</p>

<p>Sasha sat in her usual spot, surrounded by mimosas and girl talk and the comfortable</p>
<p>chaos of her friend group. Lisa. Simone. Jen. The four of them had been doing Saturday</p>
<p>brunch since grad school --- rotating restaurants, rotating drama, but always the same</p>
<p>pussy.</p>
<p>Today&#x27;s drama was Jen&#x27;s situationship with some finance bro she&#x27;d met on Hinge.</p>
<p>&quot;He texted me at 2 AM,&quot; Jen complained, stabbing at her eggs Benedict. &quot;With a &#x27;you up?&#x27;</p>
<p>Like we in college. Like I ain&#x27;t got a whole career and a 401k.-- That&#x27;s disrespect,&quot; Simone agreed. &quot;Men think any time after midnight is booty call hours.-- What did you say back?&quot; Lisa asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing! I left him on read. Let him marinate.&quot;</p>
<p>The table erupted in approval. Sasha made the right noises --- &quot;period,-- as you should,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;know your worth&quot; --- but her mind was somewhere else.</p>
<p>She was thinking about Tuesday night. The way Hades had texted her at 11:42 AM --- broad</p>
<p>daylight, during business hours --- and told her she had 45 minutes to strip naked, put on a</p>
<p>trench coat, and meet him in the woods.</p>

<p>&quot;Girl, you ain&#x27;t touched your food. You been pushing that omelet around for twenty</p>
<p>minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha looked down. Her plate was a mess of congealing cheese and cold vegetables. She</p>
<p>hadn&#x27;t taken a single bite.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m good. Just tired. Work stuff.-- Nah.&quot; Lisa&#x27;s eyes narrowed. She was looking at Sasha&#x27;s neck. At the heavy concealer that was</p>
<p>starting to crease.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Sasha forced a smile. &quot;Just been a long week.&quot;</p>
<p>Simone and Jen exchanged glances but didn&#x27;t push. The conversation moved on ---</p>
<p>somebody&#x27;s sister was getting married, somebody&#x27;s job was doing layoffs, the usual</p>
<p>rotation of blessings and complaints.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning. CafÃ© Vita, near Mateo&#x27;s office.</p>
<p>Mateo was waiting in line for his usual --- oat milk latte, light foam, the order of a man who</p>
<p>had opinions about milk alternatives. He was scrolling his phone, not really paying</p>
<p>attention, when he heard his name.</p>
<p>&quot;Mateo?&quot;</p>
<p>He looked up. Smiled automatically.</p>
<p>&quot;Lisa! Hey!&quot; He opened his arms for a hug. She gave him one --- brief, polite. &quot;Good to see</p>
<p>you. How you been?-- I been alright.&quot; Lisa studied him. The bruising around his eye was almost gone now, just a</p>
<p>faint yellow shadow. &quot;How about you? That eye looks better.-- Yeah, yeah.&quot; Mateo touched his face self-consciously. &quot;Almost back to normal. Crazy</p>
<p>what happened, right? Wrong place, wrong time.&quot;</p>
<p>If only you knew, Lisa thought. If only you knew what your girlfriend was doing while you</p>
<p>were getting jumped.</p>

<p>coffee shop like he was sharing a secret. &quot;But I&#x27;m really glad you&#x27;re doing better. Sasha told</p>

<p>She told him she was with ME?</p>
<p>Lisa thought about it for three seconds. Ran the math.</p>
<p>Sasha lied. Used her as an alibi. For what? For WHO?</p>
<p>She looked at Mateo&#x27;s earnest face. The concern in his eyes --- not for himself, but for HER.</p>
<p>For Lisa. A woman he barely knew, because his girlfriend said she&#x27;d been suicidal.</p>
<p>This sweet, stupid man got beat up in the street and he&#x27;s standing here worried about MY</p>
<p>mental health.</p>
<p>I should tell him. I should blow this whole thing up right now.</p>
<p>But she didn&#x27;t. Because Sasha was her girl. Had been her girl for over a decade. And</p>
<p>whatever was going on, Lisa wasn&#x27;t about to be the one to detonate Sasha&#x27;s whole life in a</p>
<p>coffee shop.</p>
<p>She made a choice.</p>

<p>dark night, Teo. Honestly, if Sasha hadn&#x27;t come over when she did\\...&quot; She shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know what I would have done.&quot;</p>

<p>Would she? Or would she use her friends as cover while she&#x27;s out here fucking whoever got</p>
<p>her looking like that?</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Lisa said. Her voice was tight but Mateo didn&#x27;t notice. &quot;I know she does.&quot;</p>
<p>They hugged again. Mateo got his latte. Lisa watched him walk out, that gentle, oblivious</p>

<p>She grabbed her phone and speed-walked to the stairwell --- her designated panic room.</p>
<p>Empty. Echo-y. Private.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello?-- Why does Mateo think I was suicidal last Tuesday?&quot;</p>
<p>No preamble. No hello. Just the blade coming down.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh god.&quot; Sasha pressed her forehead against the cold concrete wall. &quot;Lisa, I----- I just ran into him at CafÃ© Vita.&quot; Lisa&#x27;s voice was ice. &quot;He was asking about my &#x27;crisis.&#x27;</p>
<p>Thanking God that I&#x27;m &#x27;doing better.&#x27; Talking about how glad he is that you were there for</p>
<p>me.-- Lisa----- I covered for you.&quot; The words came out sharp. Final. &quot;He looked like a kicked puppy, so I</p>
<p>lied to his face. I played the suicidal friend. For YOU.-- Thank you. I&#x27;m so sorry, I----- Don&#x27;t thank me. EXPLAIN. Where the fuck were you Tuesday night? Because I was at spin</p>

<p>a crime scene because I couldn&#x27;t go home covered in another man&#x27;s cum?</p>

<p>&quot;Ms. Williams? This is Frank Miller, Regional Supervisor for the State Parole Board.&quot;</p>
<p>Her whole body went cold.</p>
<p>Regional Supervisor. That wasn&#x27;t a check-in. That wasn&#x27;t routine. That was the kind of call</p>
<p>that came before someone&#x27;s life changed.</p>
<p>&quot;I need you to come in immediately,&quot; Frank said. His voice was professional. Neutral.</p>
<p>Giving nothing away. &quot;We have a situation regarding your case file.-- A situation?-- I&#x27;d rather discuss it in person. Can you be at the Regional Office by 4:30?&quot;</p>
<p>No. I can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t go in there and face whatever this is.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she heard herself say. &quot;I&#x27;ll be there.&quot;</p>

<p>certificates on the walls and motivational posters about &quot;second chances&quot; and carpeting</p>

<p>Frank Miller&#x27;s office was at the end of a long hallway. Sasha walked toward it feeling like</p>
<p>she was approaching the gallows.</p>
<p>What do they know? Did somebody see something? Did Hades slip up?</p>
<p>Did I?</p>
<p>Frank Miller sat behind a mahogany desk that was too big for him. He was older --- late</p>
<p>fifties, grey at the temples, the kind of tired that came from decades of dealing with other</p>
<p>people&#x27;s fuckups. He wore a wedding ring and a brown suit that didn&#x27;t quite fit right.</p>

<p>Thorne has engaged in inappropriate conduct with a parolee under his supervision.&quot;</p>

<p>has engaged in a sexual relationship with you.&quot;</p>
<p>Somebody knows. Somebody filed a report. Somebody---</p>
<p>Wait.</p>

<p>Nobody knows about us except---</p>

<p>Hades.</p>
<p>He wasn&#x27;t in uniform. Black hoodie, grey sweatpants, Jordans. Like he&#x27;d been pulled out of</p>

<p>control over your life --- your freedom, your future. We take allegations like this very</p>
<p>seriously.&quot;</p>

<p>One nod. That&#x27;s all it would take. One nod and Hades goes to jail. Maybe for years. Maybe</p>
<p>for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Frank is offering me a way out. A clean exit. I could go home to Mateo and pretend none of</p>
<p>this ever happened.</p>

<p>look at him while he came down her throat.</p>
<p>She thought about the Polaroid. The rope she&#x27;d hidden in her tampon box. The way her</p>
<p>whole body lit up every time her phone buzzed with an unknown number.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; Sasha said. Her voice didn&#x27;t shake. &quot;Officer Thorne is strict. But nothing that would</p>
<p>amount to a complaint.&quot;</p>
<p>She met Frank&#x27;s eyes. Held them.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t file this report. I don&#x27;t know who did. But whoever it was, they&#x27;re wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Frank studied her for a long moment. Looking for the flinch. The tell. The micro-expression</p>
<p>that would give her away.</p>
<p>He found nothing. Sasha had been wearing masks her whole life. This was just one more.</p>

<p>The apartment felt like a mausoleum. Mateo was fully healed now---the bruises faded, the</p>
<p>swelling gone. He was back to his old self. Gentle. Attentive. Making her coffee in the</p>
<p>morning, rubbing her feet at night, talking about their future like it was still something real.</p>
<p>Sasha was a ghost.</p>
<p>She went through the motions. Ate when Mateo put food in front of her. Slept when her</p>
<p>body gave out. Showed up at work and yelled at contractors about things that didn&#x27;t</p>
<p>matter.</p>
<p>But she wasn&#x27;t there. Not really. She was checking her phone every thirty seconds.</p>
<p>Refreshing her email. Driving past the Parole Office on her lunch break, looking for a black</p>
<p>SUV that was never there.</p>
<p>Day two.</p>
<p>She flagged herself non-compliant in the parole system. Missed an appointment. Left the</p>
<p>box unchecked.</p>
<p>Come find me. Come drag me back.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>She lay in bed that night staring at the ceiling while Mateo snored beside her. Her body felt</p>
<p>wrong---too light, too empty. Like something essential had been scooped out and she was</p>
<p>just the shell left behind.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s punishing me. That&#x27;s what this is. He thinks I betrayed him and he&#x27;s making me feel it.</p>
<p>But she hadn&#x27;t. She&#x27;d protected him. Lied for him. Put her whole life on the line.</p>
<p>And he blocked me before I could tell him.</p>
<p>Day four.</p>
<p>She called his number sixteen times. Always the same recording: &quot;The number you have</p>
<p>reached has been disconnected.&quot;</p>
<p>She texted anyway. Watched the error messages pile up like evidence of her own</p>
<p>desperation.</p>
<p>I know you can see these somewhere. I know you&#x27;re watching. You&#x27;re always watching.</p>

<p>people come and go---men in suits, women in heels, the ordinary traffic of a world that kept</p>
<p>spinning while hers had stopped.</p>

<p>She watched the fourth-floor windows. Lights on. Someone moving behind the blinds.</p>

<p>Knowing I&#x27;m waiting.</p>
<p>Maybe he&#x27;s laughing.</p>
<p>She drove home at 8 PM. Mateo had made dinner. Chicken something. It tasted like</p>
<p>cardboard.</p>
<p>&quot;You seem distracted, baby. Work stuff?-- Yeah. Deadline.&quot;</p>
<p>Day six.</p>
<p>She couldn&#x27;t eat. The thought of food made her stomach turn. Mateo hovered, worried,</p>
<p>making her soup she didn&#x27;t touch.</p>
<p>&quot;Baby, you&#x27;re scaring me. Should I call a doctor?-- I&#x27;m fine. Just stress. It&#x27;ll pass.&quot;</p>
<p>It won&#x27;t pass. He&#x27;s in my blood. He&#x27;s in my fucking bones.</p>
<p>She lay in the bathtub that night, water gone cold, staring at the ceiling. Her phone sat on</p>
<p>the toilet lid. She&#x27;d checked it seventeen times in the last hour.</p>
<p>What if he never comes back? What if this is it? What if I spent six months learning what it</p>
<p>felt like to be alive and now I have to spend the rest of my life remembering?</p>

<p>burned.</p>

<p>couldn&#x27;t focus on the menu.</p>

<p>Sasha hadn&#x27;t been sleeping. Hadn&#x27;t been eating. She looked like exactly what she was---a</p>
<p>woman coming apart at the seams. Dark circles under her eyes. Cheekbones sharper than</p>
<p>they&#x27;d been two weeks ago. Hair pulled back in a messy twist because she couldn&#x27;t be</p>
<p>bothered to style her locs properly.</p>

<p>weren&#x27;t Mateo, who weren&#x27;t Lisa, who weren&#x27;t looking at her with concern or judgment.</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>No fucking way.</p>
<p>Hades.</p>
<p>Ten feet away. Coming out of the coffee shop&#x27;s side door.</p>
<p>He wasn&#x27;t wearing the charcoal coat. Wasn&#x27;t in uniform. He was in a black t-shirt that</p>
<p>strained against the thick muscle of his biceps, grey sweatpants that hung low on his hips.</p>
<p>He looked DOMESTIC. Relaxed. Like a man who hadn&#x27;t spent the last eighteen days</p>
<p>destroying someone&#x27;s sanity.</p>
<p>He was carrying a cardboard drink carrier with four coffees.</p>
<p>Four? Who the fuck---</p>
<p>The rage hit her before the fear did. Before the longing. Before any of the complicated</p>
<p>feelings that had been eating her alive for two and a half weeks.</p>

<p>her apartment, flagging herself non-compliant, crying into a rope that still smelled like</p>
<p>woods.</p>
<p>&quot;HADES!&quot;</p>

<p>enough to smell him. Tobacco and cold air and something darker underneath that made</p>
<p>her whole body clench.</p>

<p>beneath notice.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re making a scene, Ms. Williams.-- I don&#x27;t GIVE a shit!&quot; She was crying now. She didn&#x27;t even know when she&#x27;d started. &quot;Tell</p>

<p>The room was freezing.</p>
<p>AC blasted to maximum, turning the suite into a meat locker. Her skin erupted in</p>

<p>She opened the box.</p>
<p>Inside:</p>
<p>A tripod. Professional grade. The kind that cost more than her first car.</p>
<p>A high-end digital camera. Already charged. Red light blinking standby.</p>

<p>The first one made her stomach drop.</p>
<p>Ten inches. Black silicone. Thick enough that her fingers didn&#x27;t meet when she wrapped</p>

<p>cup base designed to stick to any surface.</p>
<p>The Impaler.</p>
<p>The second one was different. Smaller --- eight inches, smoother, with a flared base made</p>
<p>for gripping. Throat-sized. The kind of thing you held in your hand while you destroyed</p>
<p>yourself with it.</p>
<p>The Choker.</p>

<p>THE SCRIPT:</p>
<p>1\\. Set up the camera. Frame the shot so I can see everything.</p>
<p>2\\. Fix the Impaler to the glass shower door using the suction cup. Hip height.</p>
<p>3\\. The Choker goes in your throat. You control the depth. You control the pace.</p>
<p>4\\. Use your spit. No lube. For either.</p>
<p>5\\. Take them. Both. At the same time. Ass and throat.</p>
<p>6\\. Confess your sins to the lens. Tell me the truth about the restaurant. Tell me what</p>
<p>you should have done.</p>
<p>7\\. If you can take it without passing out, you&#x27;ve earned the right to come back to me.</p>

<p>He couldn&#x27;t finish. His face crumpled. The bottle slipped from his fingers and hit the carpet</p>
<p>with a dull thud.</p>
<p>Sasha stood frozen in the doorway. Her body was still humming from the Langham --- still</p>
<p>sore, still stretched, still covered in fluids that were drying tacky under her coat. She could</p>

<p>red and swollen --- he&#x27;d been crying for hours, she could tell. The fading bruise around his</p>

<p>him.</p>

<p>At the mess of her. At the body he&#x27;d slept next to for three years, now marked by someone</p>

<p>running along the underside, the smooth skin stretched tight over what felt like iron</p>
<p>underneath.</p>
<p>This has been inside me. In my throat. In my pussy. In my ass. And I still don&#x27;t know every</p>
<p>inch of it.</p>

<p>letting her come to him.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s really doing it. He&#x27;s really letting me control this.</p>
<p>She opened her mouth. Let the head slide past her lips.</p>
<p>The taste hit her immediately --- salt, musk, that masculine undertone she&#x27;d come to</p>
<p>associate with him. Her tongue found the slit, traced it, collected the bead of precum</p>
<p>already forming there.</p>
<p>Bitter. But not bad. I&#x27;m starting to like it. What does that say about me?</p>
<p>She took more. An inch. Two. Felt him nudge the back of her tongue. Her gag reflex</p>
<p>twitched --- a warning, not a full rejection.</p>
<p>She stopped. Breathed through her nose.</p>

<p>Don&#x27;t push past it yet. Just\\... sit there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enough.&quot;</p>
<p>Pulled back. Gasping. A thick rope of spit connected lips to his cock, stretching and breaking. Sucking in air. Face wrecked &quot;&quot;”Â wet from tears, chin dripping, something sliding down neck to pool in the hollow of collarbone.</p>

<p>while he didn&#x27;t touch her once below the waist. Four days of going to bed aching, empty,</p>

<p>Finally.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; She hated how breathless she sounded. How needy. But she couldn&#x27;t help it. Her</p>
<p>whole body was vibrating with want.</p>
<p>&quot;Get on the bed.&quot;</p>
<p>She scrambled up. Her legs were shaky --- an hour on her knees, even on plush carpet,</p>

<p>all fours? Whatever he wanted. She&#x27;d do whatever he wanted.</p>
<p>&quot;On your back. Head on the pillow.&quot;</p>

<p>His hands found her hips. Hooked into the waistband of her shorts. Pulled them down ---</p>
<p>slow, deliberate, exposing her inch by inch.</p>
<p>Oh god. Oh god, is he going to---</p>
<p>The shorts came off. Then her underwear --- simple cotton, soaked through, the evidence</p>

<p>every crease, found the sensitive spots she didn&#x27;t even know she had.</p>
<p>When&#x27;s the last time someone did this? Really did this? Mateo went down on me maybe</p>
<p>twice in three years. And he was terrible --- fast, mechanical, checking a box.</p>

<p>&quot;The SUV. He drives a black SUV. Escalade, I think. Big. Expensive.-- License plate?-- I didn&#x27;t --- it was dark. I wasn&#x27;t thinking about----- Any other identifying information? Where he lives? Works? Associates?&quot;</p>` },

<p>stole my girlfriend.&quot;</p>
<p>Morrison&#x27;s expression didn&#x27;t change. That patient, pitying look.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Rivera. From what you&#x27;ve described, your girlfriend left voluntarily. She got into a car</p>
<p>with another man of her own free will. That&#x27;s not theft. That&#x27;s a breakup.&quot;</p>
<p>A breakup. He&#x27;s reducing three years to a breakup.</p>

<p>controls whether she goes back to prison----- Except he&#x27;s not her parole officer. You just heard me say that.&quot;</p>
<p>Mateo&#x27;s mouth opened. Closed.</p>

<p>Hades Thorne doesn&#x27;t exist.</p>
<p>The man who beat me, who stripped me naked, who drove away with my girlfriend --- he&#x27;s a</p>
<p>ghost.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Hades Thorne Illinois</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Hades Thorne</p>
<p>A bunch of results about Greek mythology. The god of the underworld. King of the dead.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not a real name. That&#x27;s a fucking myth.</p>
<p>He thought about the video. Still saved on his phone. Her face. Her voice. I&#x27;m yours. I been</p>
<p>yours since the first time you told me to kneel.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s with someone who doesn&#x27;t exist. Someone who came out of nowhere, took her, and</p>
<p>vanished.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m the only one who knows he&#x27;s real.</p>
<p>He started the car. Pulled out of the parking lot.</p>

<p>You took everything from me. And I&#x27;m going to make you pay.</p>

<p>coffee and rage. He hadn&#x27;t slept. Couldn&#x27;t sleep. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw her</p>

<p>here? To you? For her check-ins?&quot;</p>

<p>Fresh paint smell mixing with sawdust. The bones of the building finally showing through.</p>

<p>Parole officers don&#x27;t make that kind of money.</p>

<p>But Danny had been on his ass for two weeks straight --- you gotta get out, bro, you can&#x27;t just</p>
<p>sit in that apartment --- and eventually it was easier to say yes than keep making excuses.</p>
<p>So here he was. Throwing darts he couldn&#x27;t hit. Drinking whiskey he couldn&#x27;t taste. Trying to</p>
<p>remember what normal felt like.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re up.&quot; Danny nudged him. &quot;And try to actually hit the board this time.-- Fuck off.-- I&#x27;m serious. Last throw almost hit that lady&#x27;s purse.&quot;</p>
<p>Mateo grabbed a dart. Squinted at the board like it had personally wronged him.</p>
<p>When&#x27;s the last time I did anything fun? When&#x27;s the last time I went anywhere that wasn&#x27;t a</p>
<p>PI&#x27;s office or my own apartment?</p>
<p>Two weeks of nothing. That&#x27;s the answer. Two weeks of dead ends.</p>
<p>The first investigator had been confident. Easy case, Mr. Rivera. Everyone leaves a trail.</p>
<p>Three days later, he&#x27;d called back sounding spooked. I can&#x27;t help you. Don&#x27;t call me again.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#x27;t explain. Just hung up.</p>

<p>blocking this search. Someone with resources I can&#x27;t compete with. My advice? Walk</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>The third wouldn&#x27;t even take the case after hearing the name Hades Thorne.</p>
<p>Someone&#x27;s protecting him. Someone&#x27;s making sure he stays a ghost.</p>

<p>needing to stay sharp. Now the chill raised goosebumps across her skin as she walked</p>
<p>naked to the desk where her laptop waited.</p>
<p>She&#x27;d washed Mateo off her. Every trace. The sweat, the spit, the pathetic desperation that</p>
<p>clung to weak men like cologne. He&#x27;d been useful. A means to an end. Nothing more.</p>

<p>Worth it.</p>

<p>Forty-three minutes from downtown Chicago. Empty parking lot. Isolated trails.</p>

<p>Time to see it for myself.</p>
<p>6:34 AM. North Creek Trailhead.</p>
<p>The gravel crunched under her tires as she pulled into the empty lot.</p>
<p>December in Chicago was brutal. The cold bit through her coat the moment she stepped</p>
<p>out --- but Casimira barely felt it. She&#x27;d trained in worse. Siberia. The mountains of</p>
<p>Afghanistan. A Chicago winter was nothing.</p>
<p>The lot was small. Room for maybe ten cars. And there --- at the far end --- she saw what</p>
<p>she was looking for.</p>
<p>Tire tracks.</p>
<p>Two sets.</p>
<p>She walked toward them. Crouched down. Studied the treads.</p>
<p>The first set: narrow, standard. Sedan or small SUV. Probably the woman&#x27;s car, based on</p>
<p>the positioning --- parked facing the trail, like someone who&#x27;d arrived first and waited.</p>
<p>The second set: wider, deeper. The kind of treads that came on something heavy.</p>
<p>Something expensive. Something built for power.</p>
<p>There you are, cariÃ±o.</p>
<p>She followed the tracks with her eyes. They led from the lot toward the tree line. Toward a</p>
<p>gap in the brush.</p>
<p>She walked the path.</p>
<p>Fifty feet in, she found the clearing.</p>
<p>The same clearing from the photograph. She recognized the shape --- the way the trees</p>
<p>curved around the edges, the flat stone in the center where a box might have been placed.</p>
<p>And there --- the branch.</p>
<p>Thick. Horizontal. About seven feet off the ground. The bark was worn smooth in one spot.</p>` },

<p>that picture --- to remember. To own.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not something you do with a random woman. That&#x27;s something you do with someone</p>
<p>who matters.</p>

<p>He&#x27;s been dark for months. No contact, no check-ins, no digital footprint. But he&#x27;s not</p>
<p>gone. He&#x27;s here. In Chicago. With her.</p>

<p>One ring. Two.</p>

<p>want to know everyone who comes and goes. Every vehicle. Every delivery. Everything.&quot;</p>

<p>for cover, irrelevant for purpose.</p>
<p>The hallway narrowed. Offices on either side --- most empty, some converted to storage.</p>
<p>She checked each door until she found the one with WILLIAMS on a temporary placard.</p>
<p><em>Hola, Sasha.</em></p>
<p>The office was small. Functional. A desk covered in blueprints and permits. A drafting table</p>
<p>by the window. And on the wall---</p>
<p>Photos.</p>
<p>Casimira stepped closer.</p>
<p>The first frame held Sasha and a man. Latino, soft face, kind eyes. He had his arm around</p>
<p>her waist and she was smiling --- but it was the smile of someone going through motions.</p>
<p>Pleasant. Empty.</p>
<p><em>That&#x27;s the ex. Mateo. The one I already broke.</em></p>
<p>The second frame was different. Sasha and Lisa, arms around each other, clearly drunk,</p>
<p>clearly happy. The photo looked older --- college, maybe. Before life got complicated.</p>
<p><em>There you are, rubia.</em></p>
<p>She pulled out her phone. Photographed both frames. Then she moved through the office</p>
<p>systematically --- checking drawers, scanning documents, looking for anything that might</p>
<p>lead to Hades.</p>` },

<p>toward what looked like a storage area.</p>
<p>Something about it felt familiar.</p>

<p>And at the end---</p>
<p>A corner. Hidden from the main floor. Private.</p>

<p>familiar. Are you Lisa? Sasha&#x27;s friend?&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa blinked. Surprised but not suspicious.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s me. Do I know you?-- I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve met, but I&#x27;ve seen you on Sasha&#x27;s Instagram. You two are always</p>

<p>Casimira bit her lip. Let her eyes travel over Lisa&#x27;s face --- quick, appreciative, then away</p>
<p>like she&#x27;d caught herself.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m Casimira. And honestly?&quot; She laughed, looked down, performed embarrassment</p>

<p>or whatever.-- I don&#x27;t joke.&quot; Casimira&#x27;s voice was calm. Certain. &quot;Not about this.-- But like\\... why me?&quot; Lisa dropped her hands. Looked at Casimira --- really looked. That</p>
<p>face. That body. Built like a goddamn supermodel. Even in silk pajamas, she looked like she&#x27;d stepped out of a magazine.</p>
<p>&quot;You could have anyone. Literally anyone. Why would you want----- Why not you?&quot; Casimira tilted her head. &quot;You&#x27;re beautiful. You&#x27;re fun. And you clearly need</p>` },

<p>in her green eyes. &quot;You&#x27;ve been settling, Lisa. I can tell. Men who talk big and finish fast.</p>
<p>Men who don&#x27;t know the difference between fucking and <em>fucking</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa&#x27;s breath caught. Because yeah --- that was exactly it. Every disappointing hookup.</p>
<p>Every three-minute performance. Every &quot;did you cum?&quot; when she clearly hadn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not like them.&quot; Casimira&#x27;s voice dropped. Softer now. Almost intimate. &quot;I promise you</p>
<p>--- you have never been fucked like I&#x27;m about to fuck you.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Oh my GOD.</em></p>

<p><em>Like she&#x27;s already decided.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Where&#x27;s your room?&quot;</p>
<p>The words came out before she could stop them.</p>
<p>Casimira stood. Held out her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Show me.&quot;</p>
<p>\\<em> \\</em> \\<em></p>
<p>Lisa&#x27;s bedroom was upstairs --- second floor, end of the hall.</p>
<p>Fairy lights strung along the headboard. Too many throw pillows. A framed poster of some</p>
<p>movie Casimira had never seen. The whole room smelled like vanilla candles and</p>
<p>loneliness.</p>
<p></em>Cute. Basic. Like her.<em></p>
<p>Casimira walked in first. Turned around. Watched Lisa follow her through the doorway, still</p>
<p>holding her hand, still looking like she couldn&#x27;t believe this was happening.</p>
<p></em>You have no idea what&#x27;s about to happen to you, rubia.<em></p>
<p>&quot;Close the door.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa let go of her hand. Reached for the door. Pulled it shut.</p>` },
    { chapter: 12, title: ``, content: `<p>The click of the latch was loud in the quiet room.</p>

<p>Lisa hesitated. Glanced over her shoulder. &quot;Why do I----- Don&#x27;t ask questions.&quot; Casimira&#x27;s voice was soft but firm. &quot;Just do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa turned. Her back to Casimira now. That oversized t-shirt hanging to mid-thigh, bare</p>
<p>legs underneath. Shoulders already tense with anticipation.</p>
<p>&quot;Close your eyes.-- Okay\\...&quot; Lisa&#x27;s voice was breathy. Nervous. &quot;They&#x27;re closed.&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira moved closer. Silent on bare feet. She could hear Lisa&#x27;s breathing --- shallow,</p>
<p>quick. Could see the goosebumps rising on the back of her neck.</p>
<p></em>You&#x27;re being so nice. So sweet. So ready.<em></p>
<p></em>You want me.<em></p>
<p></em>I&#x27;m going to be nice to you.<em></p>
<p>She raised her hand.</p>
<p></em>Nice-ish.<em></p>
<p>The slap connected with Lisa&#x27;s cheek.</p>
<p>Not full force. Not the crack she&#x27;d given Mateo, the one that had sent him stumbling. But</p>
<p>enough. Enough to snap her head sideways. Enough to leave a sting. Enough to leave a</p>
<p>print.</p>
<p></em>Enough to make a point.<em></p>
<p>Lisa&#x27;s eyes flew open. She spun around, hand pressed to her face, shock written across</p>
<p>her features.</p>
<p>&quot;What the FUCK? Why did you slap me?!&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira stood there. Calm. Unruffled. Arms loose at her sides.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t tell you to open your eyes.-- You HIT me----- I told you to keep them closed. You didn&#x27;t listen.&quot; Casimira stepped closer. Close enough</p>
<p>that Lisa had to tilt her head back to meet her gaze. &quot;You said you wanted the best night of</p>
<p>your life. You said you wanted to feel something real. But that&#x27;s only going to happen if you</p>
<p>listen to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa&#x27;s hand was still on her cheek. The skin was warm where Casimira&#x27;s palm had landed.</p>
<p>&quot;If you want to cum harder than you&#x27;ve ever cum in your life---&quot; Casimira&#x27;s voice dropped,</p>` },
    { chapter: 12, title: ``, content: `<p>low and certain, &quot;---you do what I say. When I say it. No questions. No hesitation.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa stared at her. Breathing hard. Eyes searching Casimira&#x27;s face for something --- a joke,</p>
<p>a tell, anything that said this wasn&#x27;t real.</p>
<p>She found nothing but certainty.</p>
<p>&quot;I promise you,&quot; Casimira continued. &quot;If you trust me --- if you let go --- you will have</p>
<p>orgasms you didn&#x27;t know your body was capable of. But only if you listen.&quot;</p>
<p>Silence. The fairy lights twinkled. Lisa&#x27;s chest rose and fell beneath her oversized shirt.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.&quot; The word came out small. Surrendered. &quot;Okay.-- Good girl.&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira stepped back. Her hands went to the hem of her silk cami.</p>
<p>She pulled it over her head in one smooth motion.</p>
<p>Her tits spilled free --- full C-cups, heavy and round, sitting high on her chest without a hint</p>
<p>of sag. Her nipples were dark brown, almost chocolate, already stiffening in the cool air of</p>
<p>the bedroom. Her waist curved inward, then flared out to hips that belonged on a</p>
<p>Renaissance painting.</p>
<p>Lisa&#x27;s mouth fell open.</p>
<p>Casimira hooked her thumbs in her pajama shorts. Slid them down. Stepped out of them.</p>
<p>Now she was naked.</p>
<p>That body --- the one Lisa had been stealing glances at all night --- was fully on display. The</p>
<p>flat stomach. The small triangle of dark hair above her pussy. The thighs that curved into an</p>
<p>ass so round and full it defied physics.</p>
<p>Lisa couldn&#x27;t stop staring.</p>
<p>&quot;Your turn.&quot; Casimira&#x27;s voice cut through the haze. &quot;Shirt off.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa&#x27;s hands were shaking as she grabbed the hem of her oversized t-shirt. She pulled it up,</p>
<p>over her head, dropped it on the floor.</p>
<p>Underneath, she was wearing a bra. White. Plain. The kind you bought in three-packs at</p>
<p>Target.</p>` },
    { chapter: 12, title: ``, content: `<p>But what it was holding---</p>
<p>&quot;Take it off.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa reached behind her. Fumbled with the clasp. Her fingers weren&#x27;t working right --- too</p>
<p>nervous, too aware of Casimira&#x27;s eyes on her.</p>
<p>Finally, the hooks released.</p>
<p>The bra fell away.</p>
<p>Her tits spilled out --- and spilled was the only word for it. Massive. Heavy. Natural. Pale with blue veins visible underneath. They</p>
<p>bounced as they fell free from the cups, settling against her chest with a weight that pulled</p>
<p>them slightly apart. Pink nipples, wide areolas, the kind of breasts that made men walk into</p>
<p>poles and women check their own chests in disappointment.</p>
<p></em>Dios mÃ­o.<em></p>
<p>&quot;My god, girl.&quot; Casimira let out a low whistle. Genuine appreciation. &quot;You are </em>blessed<em>.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa&#x27;s face went red. Her hands came up instinctively, covering herself --- palms pressing</p>
<p>against her nipples, arms trying to contain what couldn&#x27;t be contained.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop.&quot; She was looking at the floor. &quot;Don&#x27;t stare like that.-- Why not?-- Because\\...&quot; Lisa shifted her weight. Still covering herself. Still blushing from her cheeks</p>
<p>down to her chest. &quot;I don&#x27;t know. They&#x27;re too big. Guys always stare and it&#x27;s weird and I feel</p>
<p>like a freak----- Lisa.&quot; Casimira stepped closer. Close enough to touch, but not touching. &quot;Look at me.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa looked up. Those blue eyes, uncertain and vulnerable.</p>
<p>&quot;You have nothing to be shy about.&quot; Casimira said it simply. Like fact. &quot;Nothing. Your body</p>
<p>is beautiful. Those tits are fucking incredible. And before this night is over, you&#x27;re going to</p>
<p>understand exactly how incredible they are.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa swallowed. Her hands were still covering her breasts, but her grip had loosened. Her</p>
<p>breathing had changed.</p>
<p>&quot;Now. Close your eyes.-- I----- Close them.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa closed her eyes. Her hands stayed where they were --- pressed against her tits, fingers</p>` },

<p>Casimira watched her. Watched the way her chest rose and fell. Watched the way her lips</p>

<p></em>You&#x27;re being so sweet. So obedient.<em></p>

<p>The second slap landed harder.</p>
<p>Lisa&#x27;s head snapped to the side. A sound escaped her --- not a scream, not a word, just air</p>
<p>forced out of her lungs by the impact. Her cheek burned. Both of them now, matching pink</p>
<p>prints on pale skin.</p>
<p>But she didn&#x27;t open her eyes.</p>
<p>Her hands reached forward --- instinct, seeking something solid. Her fingers found skin</p>
<p>first. Soft. Round. </em>Warm<em>.</p>
<p></em>Oh god, I&#x27;m touching her---<em></p>
<p>She&#x27;d grabbed Casimira&#x27;s breast. Full palm against that perfect C-cup, that brown nipple hard against</p>
<p>her palm -- darker than Lisa expected, stiff and warm.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry--- I didn&#x27;t mean to----- It&#x27;s fine.&quot; Casimira&#x27;s voice was amused. &quot;Move your hand up.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa slid her hand up to Casimira&#x27;s shoulder. Gripped it. Steadied herself. Legs unreliable. Face throbbing. Whole body vibrating at a frequency she didn&#x27;t recognize.</p>
<p>&quot;Good girl. Eyes stay closed.-- They&#x27;re closed.-- I know.&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira moved closer. Close enough that Lisa could feel the heat radiating off her naked</p>
<p>body. Close enough that their breasts almost touched --- Lisa&#x27;s massive pale mounds</p>
<p>hovering inches from Casimira&#x27;s smaller, firmer ones.</p>
<p>Then Casimira&#x27;s hand slid down.</p>
<p>No warning. No buildup.</p>
<p>Two fingers pushed inside Lisa&#x27;s pussy --- olive fingers disappearing into pink.</p>
<p>&quot;OH---&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa&#x27;s grip on Casimira&#x27;s shoulder tightened. Her knees buckled slightly. She was wet ---</p>
<p>embarrassingly wet, soaked from everything that had happened, and Casimira&#x27;s fingers</p>
<p>slid in without resistance.</p>` },
    { chapter: 12, title: ``, content: `<p>&quot;There we go.&quot; Casimira&#x27;s voice was low. Satisfied. &quot;You&#x27;re dripping, </em>mamacita<em>.&quot;</p>
<p>She curled her fingers forward. Found that spot --- the spongy bundle of nerves that most</p>
<p>men couldn&#x27;t locate with a map and a flashlight. Her thumb found Lisa&#x27;s clit at the same</p>
<p>time, pressing down, circling.</p>
<p>Lisa made a sound that wasn&#x27;t human.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s it.&quot; Casimira started working her --- fingers stroking that spot inside while her thumb</p>
<p>kept pressure on the clit. A dual assault. Relentless. &quot;That&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve been missing.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa couldn&#x27;t respond. Could barely breathe. Her head fell forward, forehead pressing</p>
<p>against Casimira&#x27;s shoulder. Her free hand found Casimira&#x27;s other shoulder, gripping hard</p>
<p>enough to leave marks.</p>
<p>Then Casimira&#x27;s mouth found her neck.</p>
<p>Not a kiss. A bite. Teeth sinking into the soft skin just below her ear, hard enough to bruise,</p>
<p>hard enough to send a jolt of pain-pleasure straight down Lisa&#x27;s spine.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh god--- oh god oh god----- Did I tell you you could cum yet?-- I can&#x27;t--- I&#x27;m gonna----- Did I say you could?-- Please---&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira&#x27;s fingers sped up. Harder now. Faster. Her thumb grinding against Lisa&#x27;s clit in</p>
<p>tight, vicious circles. Her teeth still clamped on Lisa&#x27;s neck, marking her.</p>
<p>Lisa&#x27;s legs shook.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t hold it--- I can&#x27;t---&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira pulled back just enough to whisper in her ear.</p>
<p>&quot;Cum.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa shattered.</p>
<p>The orgasm crashed through her --- her whole body seizing, her pussy clamping down</p>
<p>on Casimira&#x27;s fingers, her scream muffled against Casimira&#x27;s shoulder. Her legs gave out</p>
<p>completely. The only thing holding her up was her death grip</p>
<p>on Casimira and Casimira&#x27;s arm around her waist.</p>
<p>She came standing up. Shaking. Gasping. Tears leaking from the corners of her still-closed</p>
<p>eyes.</p>
<p>Casimira held her through it. Kept her fingers inside, kept the pressure on her clit,</p>` },

<p>&quot;Open your mouth.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa obeyed without thinking. Her lips parted.</p>
<p>Casimira slid her two fingers --- still wet, still coated --- into Lisa&#x27;s mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;Taste yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa&#x27;s tongue moved instinctively. Tasting. Salt and musk and something sweeter</p>
<p>underneath. Her own arousal, thick on Casimira&#x27;s fingers.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you taste, girl?&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa sucked gently. Let the fingers slide out.</p>
<p>&quot;Good.&quot; Her voice was wrecked. Hoarse. &quot;I like it.-- Let me see.&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira pulled her close. Kissed her.</p>
<p>Not gentle. Not tentative. A real kiss --- tongue pushing past Lisa&#x27;s lips, tasting what Lisa</p>
<p>had just tasted, sharing the flavor of her cum between their mouths. Lisa moaned into it,</p>
<p>her body still shaking from the aftershocks.</p>
<p>When Casimira finally pulled back, Lisa was swaying.</p>
<p>&quot;Find your way to the bed.&quot; Casimira released her. Stepped back. &quot;Don&#x27;t open your eyes</p>
<p>yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa turned. Disoriented. Her hands reached out blindly, feeling for the mattress she knew</p>
<p>was somewhere behind her. Her calves bumped the frame. She lowered herself down.</p>
<p>Crawled backward until pillows pressed against her back.</p>
<p>She lay there. Naked. Spread out. Eyes still closed.</p>
<p>Waiting.</p>
<p>&quot;Open your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>Handcuffs.</p>

<p>&quot;Lisa.&quot; Casimira&#x27;s voice shifted. Still commanding, but softer now. Like a hand loosening its grip. &quot;Thank</p>

<p>something in return.&quot;</p>` },

<p>He gave her nothing.</p>
<p>Just stood there. Naked. Silent. His eyes fixed on Casimira. On the gun.</p>
<p>&quot;Your\\... husband?&quot; Sasha&#x27;s voice was barely a whisper. &quot;Hades\\... you&#x27;re MARRIED?&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira stepped closer. Her naked body moving through the shadows. The</p>
<p>gun rising another inch.</p>
<p>&quot;Married. For sixteen years. On paper, at least.&quot; Her smile turned bitter. &quot;Though I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>think he ever saw it that way. Did you, </em>mi amor<em>? To you, I was just\\... what? A</p>
<p>convenience? A hole to fuck when you were bored?&quot;</p>
<p>Hades&#x27; jaw tightened.</p>
<p>&quot;Casimira. This isn&#x27;t the time.-- No?&quot; She laughed again. Sharper now. &quot;When IS the time, Hades? When you&#x27;ve</p>
<p>been ghost for months? When the company is asking questions? When I&#x27;ve had to kill three</p>
<p>people just to keep your name out of their mouths?&quot;</p>
<p>The gun rose higher.</p>
<p>Pointed now. At Hades&#x27; chest.</p>

<p>The word was still ringing in Sasha&#x27;s ears. Still bouncing around her skull like a bullet that</p>
<p>couldn&#x27;t find its way out.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s MARRIED.</p>
<p>This woman --- this naked, gun-wielding, perfect-bodied woman --- is his WIFE.</p>
<p>Sixteen years. She said sixteen years.</p>
<p>And he never told me.</p>
<p>She was shaking. The sheets clutched to her chest were damp with sweat. Her heart was</p>
<p>beating so fast she thought it might explode.</p>
<p>&quot;Hades.&quot; Her voice came out broken. Desperate. &quot;Tell me she&#x27;s lying. Tell me this isn&#x27;t---&quot;</p>
<p>Nobody was listening to her.</p>
<p>Hades hadn&#x27;t moved. Hadn&#x27;t spoken. His eyes were locked on Casimira like nothing else</p>
<p>existed. Like Sasha wasn&#x27;t even in the room.</p>
<p>And Casimira---</p>
<p>She was still smiling. Still holding that gun. Still standing there with her perfect fucking</p>
<p>body on display like she owned the place.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s been fucking him for sixteen years.</p>
<p>Sixteen years of knowing his body. Sixteen years of---</p>
<p>&quot;---you gave me two hundred thousand dollars TODAY.&quot; Sasha&#x27;s voice rose. Cracked. &quot;You</p>
<p>rubbed my FEET. You made me feel like I was SPECIAL. And this whole time you had a</p>
<p>WIFE?&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira&#x27;s eyes flicked to her. Amused.</p>
<p>&quot;Mira, Hades.&quot; Her voice was almost impressed. &quot;She&#x27;s got fire. Not scared of the gun at</p>
<p>all.&quot;</p>
<p>She lowered the weapon. Set it on the dresser beside her. Casual. Like it was a purse she</p>
<p>was tired of holding.</p>` },

<p>THE AUDACITY.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me?! You&#x27;re standing in MY man&#x27;s bedroom talking about TASTING me? Bitch, I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t know WHO you think you are but----- Casimira.&quot;</p>
<p>Hades&#x27; voice cut through the room. Low. Flat. Dangerous.</p>
<p>Sasha stopped mid-sentence.</p>
<p>She&#x27;d never heard him sound like that before. Never heard that edge. That warning.</p>
<p>Something&#x27;s wrong.</p>
<p>Something&#x27;s really wrong.</p>
<p>HADES</p>
<p>He hadn&#x27;t taken his eyes off her once.</p>
<p>Not when she lowered the gun. Not when she set it down. Not when she touched herself</p>
<p>and made jokes about tasting Sasha.</p>
<p>The gun was never the problem.</p>
<p>Sixteen years. He&#x27;d known her for sixteen years. Trained with her. Killed beside her. Fucked</p>
<p>her. He knew every tell she had. Every shift in posture. Every breath before she moved.</p>
<p>Hair tied back. Naked. Silent.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not foreplay.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s business.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s her kill stance.</p>
<p>The last time he&#x27;d seen her like this, she&#x27;d been standing over a Russian oligarch in</p>
<p>Monaco. The man had been dead thirty seconds later. Throat crushed. No witnesses.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s not here to talk.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s here to work.</p>
<p>But work on WHO?</p>
<p>He&#x27;d gone dark. Months ago. Cut every tie. Burned every bridge. The company had no idea</p>
<p>where he was. No way to reach him.</p>
<p>Which means they sent her.</p>` },

<p>His mind raced through the possibilities. None of them good.</p>
<p>Option one: She was here to bring him back. Persuade him. Remind him of his obligations.</p>
<p>But she wouldn&#x27;t need to be naked for that.</p>
<p>Option two: She was here to assess. To see if he&#x27;d gone soft. To report back.</p>
<p>Possible. But she&#x27;s not asking questions. She&#x27;s not talking at all.</p>
<p>Option three: She was here to kill him.</p>
<p>The company decided he was a liability. Too dangerous to leave loose. And they sent the</p>
<p>only person who might be able to do it.</p>
<p>The person who already tried once.</p>
<p>His eyes found the scar on her neck. The one his thumb had left ten years ago. When she&#x27;d</p>
<p>come for him on contract and he&#x27;d caught her mid-strike. When he&#x27;d pressed his thumb</p>
<p>into her windpipe until she stopped fighting.</p>
<p>She&#x27;d never apologized. He&#x27;d never asked her to.</p>
<p>They&#x27;d just kept working together. Kept fucking. Like nothing had happened.</p>
<p>But that was then.</p>
<p>Before Sasha.</p>
<p>Before I went dark.</p>
<p>Before I became a problem.</p>
<p>&quot;Why are your clothes off?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>His voice was calm. Controlled. But underneath --- every muscle was coiled. Ready.</p>
<p>Casimira tilted her head. That smile still playing on her lips.</p>

<p>all I knew, you were dead. Or this Sasha person had you against your will.&quot;</p>
<p>Bullshit.</p>
<p>&quot;Had to come prepared. You know how it is.&quot;</p>
<p>She&#x27;s deflecting.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s not answering.</p>
<p>&quot;But as I can see\\...&quot; Her eyes swept over Sasha again. That hungry look. &quot;You found</p>
<p>yourself a nice little panocha. Can&#x27;t blame you. She&#x27;s gorgeous.&quot;</p>

<p>hurt me.</p>

<p>Barely.</p>

<p>her shoulder. Her SKULL. The kind of punch that cracks bone. Collapses eye sockets. Kills.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s not playing.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s trying to fucking KILL me.</p>
<p>Sixteen years of training kicked in. Pure instinct. She threw both arms up, crossed at the</p>
<p>wrists, and caught the blow against her forearms.</p>
<p>The impact was DEVASTATING.</p>
<p>FUCK---</p>
<p>Her whole body rocked backwards. Her heels scraped against the hardwood. The force</p>
<p>traveled up her arms, through her shoulders, down her spine. Something in her left forearm</p>
<p>screamed --- not broken, but close. Bruised deep. Maybe fractured.</p>
<p>Dios mÃ­o, he&#x27;s STRONG.</p>
<p>She&#x27;d forgotten. Or maybe she&#x27;d hoped. That months of playing house had softened him.</p>` },

<p>should move. 6&#x27;4&quot;. 255 pounds. Trained. Lethal.</p>

<p>hire him for.\\<em></p>
<p>Hades sat back. Stared at the screen.</p>
<p></em>He&#x27;s in the way.<em></p>
<p>The thought was simple. Clean. A problem to be solved.</p>
<p></em>Option one: Kill him.<em></p>
<p>Easy. He&#x27;d killed harder targets in harder places. Mateo Rivera was a painter who did odd</p>
<p>jobs. No security training. No awareness. No threat.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p></em>If he dies, she mourns him.<em></p>
<p>That was the problem. Women mourned their men. Even weak men. Even men who didn&#x27;t</p>
<p>deserve it. And a mourning woman was a broken woman --- sad, fragile, diminished.</p>
<p></em>That&#x27;s not what I want.<em></p>
<p>\\</em>I want her fire. I want that energy I felt from fifty feet away. I want the woman who runs a</p>
<p>construction site like she owns every man on it.\\<em></p>
<p></em>If I kill him, I get a widow. A shell. Something less than what I saw today.<em></p>
<p>He crossed it off the mental list.</p>
<p></em>Option two: Take her.<em></p>
<p>Also easy. He knew how to seduce. Knew how to make women want him. Could walk onto</p>
<p>that job site tomorrow, turn up the charm, have her in a hotel room by the weekend.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>\\</em>If her heart still belongs to him --- if he did nothing wrong and I just\\... stole her --- she&#x27;d be</p>
<p>torn.\\<em></p>
<p></em>Confused.<em></p>
<p>\\</em>Looking over her shoulder. Wondering if she made the right choice. Comparing me to</p>
<p>him.\\<em></p>
<p>The thought made his jaw tighten.</p>
<p></em>I don&#x27;t share.<em></p>
<p></em>Not her attention. Not her thoughts. Not one inch of her heart.<em></p>
<p>\\</em>And the idea that she could be confused --- that she could even CONSIDER someone as</p>
<p>small and fragile and weak as Mateo Rivera when she has ME---\\<em></p>
<p></em>No.<em></p>` },

<p>He needed a third option. Something cleaner. Something that removed the obstacle</p>
<p>without damaging the prize.</p>
<p></em>Option three: Make him the villain.<em></p>
<p>\\</em>Send him to prison. Let HER be the one who&#x27;s wronged. Let HIM be the one who failed her,</p>
<p>betrayed her, destroyed her life.\\<em></p>

<p>him.\\<em></p>

<p>her what that weak, useless painter never could.\\<em></p>
<p>\\</em>She can&#x27;t wait forever. Even if she dates someone new while he&#x27;s gone, she won&#x27;t have</p>

<p>crosses that section to get to the east wing.\\<em></p>

<p>No reason for her to be walking across Section C.\\<em></p>

<p>Some men wouldn&#x27;t understand. They&#x27;d call it evil. Monstrous.</p>
<p>But Hades didn&#x27;t operate on their morality.</p>
<p>He operated on a simple truth: He would burn everything and everyone --- every building,</p>
<p>every life, every inch of the world --- if it left nothing but a ten-by-ten square with him and</p>
<p>Sasha standing on it.</p>
<p>This wasn&#x27;t evil.</p>

<p>Grade-60 rebar was the industry standard. Strong. Reliable. Rated for the load-bearing</p>
<p>requirements of a commercial walkway.</p>
<p>Grade-40 was cheaper. Weaker. Fine for decorative applications, non-load-bearing</p>
<p>structures. But under the weight of heavy foot traffic, heavy equipment, men carrying tools</p>
<p>and materials back and forth all day?</p>
<p>It would fail.</p>
<p>Not immediately. That was the beauty of it. The walkway would hold for a few days. Maybe</p>
<p>a week. Long enough for Mateo to finish his work and move on to another section. Long</p>
<p>enough for nobody to be watching when the first cracks appeared.</p>
<p>And then someone would step wrong. Or a forklift would cross at a bad angle. Or just the</p>
<p>accumulated stress of a thousand footsteps would finally push the compromised</p>
<p>structure past its breaking point.</p>
<p><em>Someone will get hurt.</em></p>

<p>That was the only variable that mattered.</p>
<p><em>It won&#x27;t be Sasha.</em></p>
<p>He&#x27;d studied her patterns. She never walked Section C. Her office was on the ground floor,</p>
<p>east side. Her scaffolding work was in the north wing. She had no reason to cross that</p>
<p>walkway.</p>

<p>Hades moved through the darkness like he was part of it. No flashlight. No sound. Just</p>

<p>The materials storage was in a trailer on the east side. Locked, but not seriously. A padlock</p>

<p>appearance. Different rating.</p>
<p></em>Different outcome.<em></p>

<p>Another pause. Longer this time.</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Williams, I understand your confusion. But the transfer has already been processed.</p>
<p>Your new representation will explain everything. I suggest you take the meeting.&quot;</p>
<p>The line went dead.</p>
<p>Sasha stared at her phone.</p>
<p>What the fuck just happened?</p>
<p>THE CONSULTATION --- SASHA</p>
<p>The new lawyer&#x27;s office wasn&#x27;t in Chicago.</p>
<p>It was in a building Sasha had walked past a hundred times but never entered --- the kind of</p>
<p>building with a doorman and a lobby made of marble and the quiet hum of money so old it</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t need to be loud.</p>
<p>The elevator took her to the 40th floor. The receptionist --- a woman in a suit that cost more</p>
<p>than Sasha&#x27;s rent --- smiled like she&#x27;d been expecting her.</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Williams. Mr. Chen will see you now.&quot;</p>
<p>Chen.</p>
<p>The name hit her before she reached the office door.</p>
<p>Robert Chen. Chen &amp; Associates. The firm that defended Senator Morrison last year. The</p>
<p>firm that got the Hartwell CEO acquitted on fourteen counts of fraud.</p>
<p>That Chen?</p>
<p>The door opened.</p>
<p>He was younger than she expected. Mid-forties, maybe. Asian American. Tailored suit ---</p>
<p>not flashy, but the kind of understated expensive that screamed generational wealth. Silver</p>
<p>watch. No wedding ring. Eyes that assessed her in a single glance and found her</p>` },

<p>&quot;Miss Williams.&quot; He stood, extended a hand. &quot;Thank you for coming. Please, sit.&quot;</p>
<p>She didn&#x27;t sit. Not yet.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t authorize a transfer.-- I know.-- Then why am I here?&quot;</p>
<p>Chen gestured to the chair across from his desk. Patient. Like he&#x27;d had this conversation</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>&quot;Please. Sit. I&#x27;ll explain everything.&quot;</p>
<p>She sat. Didn&#x27;t relax.</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Williams, I&#x27;m going to be direct with you. Your previous attorney --- Mr. Patterson --- is</p>
<p>a competent lawyer. For traffic violations. Maybe a DUI if you&#x27;re lucky.&quot; He opened a folder</p>
<p>on his desk. &quot;You&#x27;re facing criminal negligence charges in connection with an incident that</p>
<p>left a man paralyzed. The prosecution is pushing for fifteen to twenty years. Mandatory</p>
<p>minimum.&quot;</p>
<p>The blood drained from Sasha&#x27;s face.</p>
<p>&quot;Fifteen to\\... my lawyer said ten. Maybe five on probation if----- Your lawyer was wrong.&quot; Chen&#x27;s voice was flat. Not cruel --- just factual. &quot;The DA wants to</p>
<p>make an example. Construction safety. Corporate accountability. You&#x27;re the face they&#x27;re</p>
<p>going to put on it. Patterson doesn&#x27;t have the resources, the connections, or frankly the</p>
<p>skill to fight that.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha&#x27;s hands were shaking. She pressed them flat against her thighs.</p>
<p>Fifteen to twenty years.</p>
<p>I thought I was saving Mateo. I thought by taking the fall---</p>
<p>I made it worse.</p>
<p>&quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot; Her voice came out smaller than she wanted. &quot;I can&#x27;t afford</p>
<p>you. I know your firm. I know what you charge. I make good money --- made good money ---</p>
<p>but I couldn&#x27;t pay your retainer if I sold everything I own.&quot;</p>
<p>Chen closed the folder. Leaned back in his chair.</p>
<p>&quot;Your fees have been covered.-- Covered? By who?-- An anonymous donor.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha stared at him. &quot;Anonymous donor? What does that mean? Like a foundation? A</p>` },
    { chapter: 15, title: ``, content: `<p>charity?-- I&#x27;m not at liberty to disclose the source.&quot; Chen&#x27;s face gave nothing away. &quot;What I can tell</p>
<p>you is this: your representation has been paid in full. Not just for the trial --- for the duration</p>
<p>of your case. If that&#x27;s six months, I&#x27;m your lawyer for six months. If it&#x27;s ten years, I&#x27;m your</p>
<p>lawyer for ten years.-- That&#x27;s\\...&quot; Sasha did the math. Couldn&#x27;t do the math. The numbers were too big. &quot;That&#x27;s</p>
<p>millions of dollars.-- Yes.-- For me? Someone paid millions of dollars. For MY case?-- Yes.-- Why?&quot;</p>
<p>Chen was quiet for a moment. Then: &quot;Miss Williams, I&#x27;ve been practicing law for twenty-</p>
<p>two years. I&#x27;ve represented senators, CEOs, foreign dignitaries. I&#x27;ve had clients wire money</p>
<p>from Swiss accounts, from shell corporations, from governments that don&#x27;t officially</p>
<p>exist.&quot;</p>
<p>He leaned forward.</p>
<p>&quot;In all that time, I have never --- not once --- received a retainer like the one that landed on</p>
<p>my desk for your case. The amount was\\...&quot; He paused, choosing his words. &quot;Significant.</p>
<p>Enough to ensure that you are my sole priority until this matter is resolved. Enough that the</p>
<p>firm has assigned four additional associates to your case. Enough that I flew here from DC</p>
<p>this morning and will fly back tonight, and I will do that as many times as necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha couldn&#x27;t breathe.</p>
<p>&quot;The instructions were simple: Get her out. Whatever it takes. Money is not an object.&quot;</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Who would do this?</p>
<p>Who even KNOWS me that has this kind of money?</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t understand,&quot; she whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t have to understand.&quot; Chen stood. Walked to the window. Looked out at the</p>
<p>Chicago skyline. &quot;All you have to do is trust me. Follow my instructions. And don&#x27;t ask</p>` },

<p>to pay more than most people will earn in a lifetime. I don&#x27;t know who. I don&#x27;t know why.</p>
<p>And frankly? I don&#x27;t care. My job is to get results. And I&#x27;m very good at my job.&quot;</p>
<p>He returned to his desk. Pulled out a fresh folder.</p>
<p>&quot;Now. Let&#x27;s talk about your defense.&quot;</p>
<p>SIX MONTHS --- SASHA</p>
<p>Chen got her six months.</p>
<p>The trial lasted three days. He dismantled the prosecution&#x27;s case piece by piece --- chain of</p>
<p>custody issues, inconsistent inspection reports, a confession given without adequate</p>
<p>counsel. By the time closing arguments came, the mandatory minimum was off the table.</p>
<p>Six months. Minimum security.</p>
<p>The judge called it lenient. The DA called it a travesty.</p>
<p>Sasha called it a miracle she didn&#x27;t understand.</p>
<p>DECATUR CORRECTIONAL CENTER --- SASHA</p>
<p>She was supposed to go to Logan.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what the paperwork said. Logan Correctional --- general population, medium</p>
<p>security. The kind of place where women did hard time. Where fights happened in the yard</p>
<p>and the showers and sometimes the cells. Where a woman like Sasha --- educated,</p>
<p>professional, soft --- would be meat.</p>
<p>Forty-eight hours after sentencing, the paperwork changed.</p>
<p>Transfer to Decatur. Federal minimum security. White-collar wing.</p>
<p>Nobody explained why. The guard who processed her just shrugged --- &quot;Bureaucracy, I</p>
<p>guess&quot; --- and handed her a new jumpsuit.</p>
<p>Decatur was different. Cleaner. Quieter. The kind of prison where accountants and insider</p>
<p>traders served their time, took classes, read books in the library.</p>
<p>Sasha kept her head down. Did her time. Counted the days.</p>
<p>One hundred eighty-two days. That&#x27;s all. Then I&#x27;m out. Then I rebuild.</p>` },

<p>THE SHOWER --- SASHA</p>
<p>It happened in week two.</p>
<p>Sasha was alone. Rinsing shampoo from her locs. The water was lukewarm --- never hot</p>
<p>enough, never quite clean enough. She&#x27;d learned to shower fast, keep her eyes open, stay</p>
<p>aware.</p>
<p>She wasn&#x27;t aware enough.</p>
<p>The first punch caught her in the kidney.</p>
<p>The pain was blinding. White-hot. She went down hard, knees cracking against wet tile.</p>
<p>&quot;You think you better than us?&quot;</p>
<p>A woman stood over her. Big. Built like she&#x27;d spent her whole life fighting. Face like a scar</p>
<p>with eyes.</p>
<p>Davis. Sasha had seen her in the yard. Heard the whispers. Third strike. Assault. Nothing</p>
<p>left to lose.</p>
<p>&quot;Walking around here like you don&#x27;t belong?&quot; Davis grabbed a fistful of Sasha&#x27;s locs.</p>
<p>Yanked her head back. &quot;Like this place is beneath you?-- I don&#x27;t---&quot; Sasha gasped. &quot;I don&#x27;t think---&quot;</p>
<p>Another punch. Ribs this time. Something cracked.</p>
<p>&quot;I asked you a question, bitch.&quot;</p>
<p>Two other women stood at the shower entrance. Lookouts. Nobody was coming to help.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m just trying to do my time.&quot; Sasha&#x27;s voice was a rasp. Blood in her mouth. &quot;I don&#x27;t want</p>
<p>any trouble.-- Nah.&quot; Davis leaned close. Breath hot and sour. &quot;You DO think you&#x27;re better. I can see it.</p>
<p>College girl. Architect. Got that fancy lawyer. Got transferred to the soft prison. You think</p>
<p>we don&#x27;t notice?&quot;</p>
<p>The next hit was to her face.</p>
<p>Sasha&#x27;s head snapped back. Her vision went white.</p>
<p>&quot;Somebody&#x27;s looking out for you. Somebody with money.&quot; Davis hit her again. &quot;But they</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t here now, are they?&quot;</p>
<p>The beating lasted two minutes. Maybe three. Felt like hours.</p>` },
    { chapter: 15, title: ``, content: `<p>When it was over, Sasha lay on the tile. Water running pink around her. Blood from her</p>
<p>nose, her lip, somewhere she couldn&#x27;t identify.</p>

<p>Nobody came to help.</p>
<p>Sasha lay there until the water ran cold.</p>
<p>THE NEXT MORNING --- SASHA</p>
<p>She woke to screaming.</p>
<p>Not her own. Someone else. Down the hall. Then more voices. Shouting. Running</p>
<p>footsteps.</p>
<p>Sasha sat up in her bunk. Her whole body ached --- ribs, face, kidney. Moving hurt.</p>
<p>Breathing hurt.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s happening?</p>
<p>The cell block was chaos. Guards running past. Inmates pressed against their bars, trying</p>
<p>to see.</p>
<p>A woman in the cell next to Sasha&#x27;s --- Martinez, some fraud charge --- was pale. Shaking.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s going on?&quot; Sasha asked.</p>
<p>Martinez looked at her. Something in her eyes that Sasha didn&#x27;t understand.</p>
<p>&quot;Davis,&quot; she whispered. &quot;They found Davis.-- Found her? What do you mean found her?&quot;</p>
<p>Martinez didn&#x27;t answer. Just kept staring at Sasha like she was seeing her for the first time.</p>
<p>It took three hours for the story to spread.</p>
<p>Davis was dead.</p>
<p>Not just dead. Destroyed.</p>
<p>Someone had beaten her. The kind of beating that broke bones, ruptured organs, caved in</p>
<p>her face until she was barely recognizable. The kind of beating that took time. That took</p>
<p>hate.</p>
<p>And then they&#x27;d hanged her.</p>
<p>Sheet twisted around her neck. Tied to the top bunk. Body dangling, feet just off the</p>
<p>ground.</p>
<p>But that wasn&#x27;t the part that made guards go pale. That wasn&#x27;t the part that had the warden</p>
<p>calling emergency meetings and the FBI showing up by noon.</p>
<p>It was the wall.</p>
<p>Behind Davis&#x27;s body. Written in her own blood. Letters three feet tall.</p>

    { chapter: 15, title: ``, content: `<p>What the fuck does that MEAN?</p>
<p>The words meant nothing to her. Some kind of message --- but for who? About what?</p>
<p>The prison went on lockdown for three days. FBI agents interviewed everyone. Reviewed</p>
<p>camera footage that somehow showed nothing --- every camera in Davis&#x27;s wing had</p>
<p>malfunctioned between 2 and 4 AM. Guards who should have been patrolling were on</p>
<p>break, or in the bathroom, or somewhere else they couldn&#x27;t quite remember.</p>
<p>No witnesses. No evidence. No explanation.</p>
<p>Just a dead woman and three words in blood.</p>
<p>Sasha told them what happened in the shower. Told them Davis had attacked her. Showed</p>
<p>them the bruises, still fresh and purple on her ribs.</p>
<p>They wrote it down. Asked if she knew anyone who might have done this.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&#x27;t know anyone. I don&#x27;t have anyone. I don&#x27;t understand any of this.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the truth.</p>
<p>The isolation started the day after lockdown lifted.</p>
<p>It was subtle at first. The seat next to her in the cafeteria staying empty. Conversations</p>
<p>stopping when she walked past. Eyes sliding away from hers in the yard.</p>
<p>They think I did it.</p>
<p>They think I killed her, or had her killed, or---</p>
<p>But that wasn&#x27;t it. She could tell by the way they looked at her. Not angry. Not accusatory.</p>
<p>Afraid.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re afraid of me.</p>
<p>Why are they afraid of ME?</p>
<p>She tried to talk to Martinez once. Ask her what was going on. Martinez just shook her head</p>
<p>and walked away.</p>
<p>The message spread without words. Through the invisible network that existed in every</p>
<p>prison --- the whispers, the knowing glances, the information that passed between inmates</p>
<p>like contraband.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t touch her.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t talk to her.</p>

<p>Sasha spent the remaining five months of her sentence in perfect, untouched solitude.</p>
<p>No one touched her. No one talked to her. No one made eye contact.</p>

<p>The silence this time was different. Calculating.</p>
<p>&quot;Five million,&quot; Hades repeated. &quot;Wired to whatever account you specify within the hour.</p>
<p>Nonrefundable. That&#x27;s your retainer for the duration of her case. If it takes six months, you</p>
<p>bill against it. If it takes ten years, you bill against it. Whatever&#x27;s left when she walks free,</p>
<p>you keep.-- That&#x27;s\\...&quot; Chen cleared his throat. &quot;That&#x27;s an unusual arrangement.-- I&#x27;m an unusual client.-- I don&#x27;t even know who you are.-- You don&#x27;t need to. All you need to know is this: that woman does not go to prison for</p>
<p>fifteen years. I don&#x27;t care what it costs. I don&#x27;t care what you have to do. Get her out.-- And if I can&#x27;t?&quot;</p>
<p>Hades smiled in the dark.</p>
<p>&quot;Then I&#x27;ll find someone who can. And I&#x27;ll make sure everyone knows that Robert Chen ---</p>
<p>the great Robert Chen --- couldn&#x27;t win a case that a public defender could have handled.&quot;</p>
<p>The threat landed. He could hear it in the change of Chen&#x27;s breathing.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re serious.-- I&#x27;m always serious.-- Five million. Wired within the hour.-- Within the hour.&quot;</p>
<p>Another pause. Then: &quot;What&#x27;s your relationship to this woman? Wife? Family?-- She doesn&#x27;t know I exist.&quot;</p>

<p>prey before it strikes.</p>
<p>This woman put her hands on Sasha.</p>
<p>Made her bleed.</p>
<p>Made her afraid.</p>
<p>He stepped inside. Closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>Davis woke when he grabbed her throat.</p>
<p>Her eyes went wide. Confused at first --- then terrified as she registered the size of him, the</p>
<p>grip on her windpipe, the complete absence of mercy in his face.</p>
<p>She tried to scream. Couldn&#x27;t. He was crushing her airway.</p>

<p>&quot;She didn&#x27;t do anything to you. She was just trying to survive. And you decided to make her</p>
<p>your victim.&quot;</p>
<p>He released her throat. Let her gasp one breath. Two.</p>
<p>Then he broke her arm.</p>
<p>The snap was loud in the small cell. Davis&#x27;s scream was louder --- but it died in her throat</p>
<p>when his hand clamped over her mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s for touching her.&quot;</p>
<p>He broke the other arm.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s for making her bleed.&quot;</p>
<p>He went to work on her ribs. Methodical. Precise. The kind of damage that hurt before it</p>
<p>killed.</p>
<p>Davis stopped screaming after the fourth rib. Stopped fighting after the sixth. By the time</p>
<p>he reached her face, she was barely conscious.</p>
<p>&quot;I want you to understand something.&quot; He leaned close. His breath warm on her ruined</p>
<p>face. &quot;You&#x27;re dying because you touched something that belongs to me. This isn&#x27;t random.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t bad luck. This is consequence.&quot;</p>
<p>He straightened.</p>
<p>&quot;And when they find you in the morning, everyone in this prison is going to understand the</p>
<p>same thing: Sasha Williams is off limits. To everyone. Forever.&quot;</p>
<p>Davis made a sound. Might have been begging. Might have been her last breath leaving her</p>
<p>body.</p>
<p>Hades didn&#x27;t care.</p>
<p>He grabbed the sheet from her bed. Twisted it into a rope. Looped it around her neck.</p>
<p>She was still alive when he hoisted her up. Still twitching when he tied the other end to the</p>
<p>top bunk.</p>

<p>PRESENT DAY --- MORNING --- THE PENTHOUSE</p>
<p>Sunlight cut through the bedroom windows.</p>

<p>mattress. The cold where his body used to be.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes.</p>
<p>He was standing at the window. Naked. Looking out at the city like he was memorizing it.</p>
<p>Casimira was already dressed. Leaning against the doorframe with her arms crossed.</p>
<p>Watching him the way she always did --- like she was calculating something.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to leave,&quot; Casimira said. &quot;Now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean, leave? What&#x27;s going on?&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira&#x27;s eyes flicked to her. Then back to Hades.</p>
<p>&quot;I came looking for him,&quot; she said. &quot;And I found him. Which isn&#x27;t good.-- Why not?-- Because if I can find him, others can too.&quot; Casimira pushed off the doorframe. Walked</p>
<p>toward the window. &quot;You&#x27;re not hiding deep enough. This spot is burned. We need to go.&quot;</p>
<p>Hades finally turned. His face was unreadable.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you report in?-- A week ago. When I first arrived in Chicago. I told them I was tracking you.&quot; Casimira</p>
<p>paused. &quot;I haven&#x27;t updated since. Any moment now, my phone&#x27;s going to start buzzing.</p>
<p>Demanding a status report.-- And what are you going to tell them?&quot;</p>
<p>Silence stretched between them. Sixteen years of history. Sixteen years of blood and</p>
<p>bodies and the kind of trust that only came from saving each other&#x27;s lives.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not going back, Casimira.&quot;</p>
<p>She looked at him. Looked through him. Then her gaze shifted to Sasha --- still in bed, still</p>
<p>naked, still watching this conversation like she was trying to learn a language she didn&#x27;t</p>
<p>speak.</p>
<p>A regular woman. Not trained. Not part of the life. A woman who, by every metric that</p>
<p>mattered, should have been terrified. Should have run. Should have called the cops.</p>
<p>Should have done anything other than what she did --- which was stay. Enjoy. Have fun.</p>
<p>Live.</p>

<p>for her.&quot;</p>
<p>Hades didn&#x27;t respond. Didn&#x27;t need to.</p>
<p>&quot;So like I said---&quot; Casimira pulled out her phone. Looked at it for a long moment. Then</p>
<p>dropped it on the hardwood floor. &quot;---we need to go.&quot;</p>
<p>She brought her heel down. The screen shattered. She twisted her foot, grinding the</p>
<p>components into pieces.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to assume my phone was being tracked. The encryption is only untraceable from</p>
<p>people who didn&#x27;t give you the encryption in the first place.&quot; She kicked the debris aside.</p>
<p>&quot;Get dressed. Both of you. We leave in five minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>THE STAIRS --- PRESENT DAY</p>
<p>They took the stairs.</p>
<p>Hades first. Then Sasha. Then Casimira bringing up the rear --- eyes scanning, body alert,</p>
<p>the easy posture of someone who&#x27;d spent decades expecting violence around every</p>
<p>corner.</p>
<p>Sasha was still processing. Still trying to make sense of the last twelve hours. The sex. The</p>
<p>revelations. The woman who&#x27;d walked in on them and somehow ended up joining them.</p>
<p>And now they were fleeing.</p>
<p>This is my life now. Running from people I don&#x27;t know, for reasons I don&#x27;t understand, with a</p>
<p>man who doesn&#x27;t officially exist.</p>
<p>She should be terrified.</p>
<p>She wasn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>Casimira fell into step beside her as they descended.</p>
<p>&quot;You did well last night.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha glanced at her. &quot;Excuse me?-- In the bedroom.&quot; Casimira&#x27;s voice was casual. Like they were discussing the weather.</p>
<p>&quot;Most women freeze up. Get overwhelmed. You didn&#x27;t.&quot;</p>
<p>Is she\\... complimenting me?</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve had practice,&quot; Sasha said carefully.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmm.&quot; Casimira&#x27;s lips curved. &quot;He trained you well. But that thing you did --- when you</p>` },

<p>instinct.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha felt heat rise to her cheeks. Remembered the moment --- Casimira between her</p>
<p>thighs, and Sasha grabbing her by the hair, pulling her closer, commanding instead of</p>
<p>receiving.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know what came over me.-- I do.&quot; Casimira&#x27;s smile widened. &quot;You&#x27;re a natural. Most people are one or the other ---</p>
<p>dominant or submissive. You&#x27;re both. You just needed permission to access it.&quot;</p>
<p>They descended another flight. Hades was ahead of them, moving fast, not looking back.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I tell you something?&quot; Casimira asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Do I have a choice?-- No.&quot; She laughed --- a genuine sound, warm and unexpected. &quot;I&#x27;ve only ever been</p>
<p>dominated by one person. In my entire life. Sixteen years of this work, and only one man</p>
<p>has ever made me submit.&quot;</p>
<p>She nodded toward Hades.</p>
<p>&quot;Him. And even then, it took years. He had to earn it.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha watched the back of Hades&#x27; head. The tension in his shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s your point?-- My point is --- you did it in thirty seconds.&quot; Casimira&#x27;s voice dropped. Almost admiring.</p>
<p>&quot;You told me to come here, and I came. Without thinking. Without hesitating. Just\\... came.-- I didn&#x27;t mean to----- I know. That&#x27;s what makes it interesting.&quot; Casimira stepped closer. Close enough that</p>
<p>Sasha could smell her perfume --- something dark and floral. &quot;I taught him everything he</p>
<p>knows, you know. About the work. About control. About reading people.-- So?-- So I could teach you too.&quot; Her hand brushed Sasha&#x27;s lower back. Light. Almost accidental.</p>
<p>&quot;If you wanted.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha didn&#x27;t know how to respond to that.</p>
<p>This woman killed people last night. Watched me fuck the man she&#x27;s known for twenty</p>
<p>years. And now she&#x27;s offering to\\... what? Train me?</p>` },

<p>They reached the ground floor.</p>
<p>The lobby was quiet. Early morning. A bored doorman scrolling through his phone. Marble</p>
<p>floors gleaming under recessed lighting.</p>
<p>Hades slowed as they approached the exit. Turned to look at Sasha.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s an envelope,&quot; he said. &quot;In the bag I packed for you. I need you to read it. When</p>
<p>you&#x27;re safe.-- An envelope?-- Everything you need to know. In case---&quot; He stopped. Something flickered across his face.</p>
<p>Something human. &quot;In case something happens.-- Nothing&#x27;s going to happen.-- Sasha.-- Nothing&#x27;s going to happen.&quot; She said it harder this time. Like saying it with enough force</p>
<p>would make it true.</p>
<p>He looked at her for a long moment. All the things he wasn&#x27;t saying written in his eyes.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know how this ends.</p>
<p>&quot;When you&#x27;re safe,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Read it.&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira was already at the door. Hand on the glass. Ready to push it open.</p>
<p>Then she stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;Sasha, honey---&quot; She turned back. Frowned. &quot;Something&#x27;s wrong with your shoes. The left</p>
<p>one.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha looked down. The lace was undone. Trailing on the marble.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. Thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>She knelt to tie it. Casimira waited.</p>
<p>Hades didn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>He walked past both of them. First to reach the door. First to push it open. The morning air</p>
<p>hit his face --- cool, crisp, the smell of the city waking up.</p>
<p>He turned his head back. Started to say something.</p>
<p>Y&#x27;all want to grab something to---</p>
<p>THE STREET --- PRESENT DAY</p>

<p>She was looking at the marriage certificate. At the account numbers. At the life that had</p>
<p>been waiting for her this whole time without her knowing.</p>
<p>Her chest unlocked. Not grief --- escape. The first breath after drowning. Something that felt like a door</p>
<p>opening.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t go back to normal. She&#x27;s right. I can&#x27;t.</p>
<p>But maybe I don&#x27;t have to.</p>
<p>She gathered the papers. Slid them back into the envelope. Stood up from the table.</p>
<p>&quot;Sash? Where you going?&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha walked around to Lisa&#x27;s side. Leaned down. Pressed a long, slow kiss to her cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, girl.&quot; Her voice was soft. Steady. &quot;I don&#x27;t want you to worry about me. Okay? If you</p>
<p>don&#x27;t hear from me for a while, just know I&#x27;m okay.&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa&#x27;s face twisted with confusion. &quot;What the fuck are you talking about?-- I just need to go home and think about some stuff.-- Think about--- Sash, who is this marriage? This bitch gives you something, and now you&#x27;re</p>
<p>talking about &#x27;if you don&#x27;t hear from me&#x27;? What the hell is going on?&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha straightened. Looked down at her best friend of twenty years. The woman who&#x27;d</p>
<p>covered for her. Lied for her. Held her when she fell apart.</p>
<p>&quot;Lisa. If you don&#x27;t hear from me\\... just know he was the best thing I could have asked for.</p>` },

<p>her shoulder. &quot;But I do have to go. Okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Lisa stood up. Grabbed her arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Shit. At least call me, girl. You know I worry.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha smiled. It was the first real smile she&#x27;d managed in a month.</p>
<p>&quot;I will.&quot;</p>
<p>She walked out.</p>
<p>The bell chimed behind her.</p>
<p>24 HOURS LATER --- FLASHBACK: THE VAN</p>
<p>One week before the shooting.</p>
<p>Casimira sat in the back of a black panel van. Tinted windows. Climate controlled. Screens</p>
<p>mounted on every surface showing surveillance feeds from across the city.</p>
<p>She had six phones spread out on the console in front of her. Different numbers. Different</p>
<p>identities. Different purposes.</p>
<p>One of them was labeled: MATEO&#x27;S PI</p>
<p>She picked it up. Typed a message.</p>
<p>PI: Got a tip. Anonymous source reached out. Your ex Sasha Williams is meeting her friend</p>
<p>Lisa at a coffee shop tomorrow morning. After that she&#x27;s going back to where Hades lives.</p>
<p>This might be your only chance to find him.</p>
<p>She hit send.</p>
<p>Watched the &quot;delivered&quot; notification appear.</p>
<p>There you go, little painter.</p>
<p>Go buy your gun. Follow your breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>You think you&#x27;re the hunter.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t even know you&#x27;re the bait.</p>
<p>She set the phone down. Picked up another one. Made a different call.</p>
<p>&quot;I need a body. Male. Similar build to the target. Have it ready within 48 hours.&quot;</p>
<p>She hung up.</p>
<p>Smiled.</p>
<p>Everything was falling into place.</p>
<p>FLASHBACK: THE MORNING OF THE SHOOTING</p>
<p>Two hours before Hades walked out that door.</p>
<p>They were getting dressed. Sasha in the bathroom. Hades pulling on his clothes. Casimira</p>
<p>watching him from the doorway.</p>` },

<p>Hades glanced at her. &quot;What?-- Nothing. Just thinking.&quot; She walked closer. Straightened his collar. &quot;I&#x27;m glad you always</p>
<p>remembered everything I taught you. All those years. All those lessons.&quot;</p>
<p>He looked at her for a moment. Something passing behind his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Why you getting sentimental?-- Can&#x27;t I just be nostalgic?&quot; She smiled. Stepped back. &quot;We&#x27;ve been through a lot. That&#x27;s</p>
<p>all.&quot;</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t respond. Just finished buttoning his shirt.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to leave,&quot; she said. &quot;Now. Get dressed. Both of you.&quot;</p>
<p>FLASHBACK: 5:47 AM --- THE MORNING OF THE SHOOTING</p>
<p>One hour before they woke up.</p>
<p>Casimira slipped out of the penthouse while they were still asleep.</p>
<p>She took the service elevator. Walked three blocks to a parking garage where a van was</p>
<p>waiting.</p>
<p>Inside the van: two men. Gang affiliated. Paid well. And between them --- Danny.</p>
<p>Mateo&#x27;s best friend.</p>
<p>He was gagged. Hands zip-tied. Eyes wild with terror.</p>
<p>&quot;This him?&quot; Casimira asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. Grabbed him an hour ago. He was sleeping on his couch.-- Good.&quot;</p>
<p>She pulled out a Glock. Same model as the one Mateo had bought. Same caliber bullets.</p>
<p>Danny&#x27;s eyes went wider. He tried to scream through the gag.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing personal,&quot; Casimira said. &quot;You&#x27;re just a loose end. And I needed a body.&quot;</p>
<p>She shot him three times in the chest.</p>
<p>The sound was deafening in the enclosed space. Danny slumped forward. Dead before he</p>
<p>hit the floor of the van.</p>
<p>Casimira turned to the two men.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you for your service.&quot;</p>
<p>She shot them both. One in the head. One in the throat.</p>
<p>No witnesses. No loose ends.</p>
<p>She wiped down the gun. Bagged it. Pulled out her phone.</p>` },

<p>Walked back to the penthouse.</p>
<p>Slipped into bed like she&#x27;d never left.</p>
<p>COOK COUNTY JAIL --- VISITING ROOM</p>
<p>Mateo had been in holding for thirty days.</p>
<p>Thirty days of confusion. Thirty days of questions with no answers. Thirty days of a</p>
<p>nightmare that wouldn&#x27;t end.</p>
<p>He&#x27;d shot Hades Thorne. He KNEW he&#x27;d shot him. Three times in the chest. Watched him</p>
<p>fall. Watched the blood pool beneath him.</p>
<p>And then --- nothing.</p>
<p>By the time the cops cuffed him, the body was gone. The blood was gone. The witnesses</p>
<p>were gone. It was like it never happened.</p>
<p>But he still got booked. Still got charged. Still got a closed court hearing with no jury, no</p>
<p>press, no explanation.</p>
<p>MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE.</p>
<p>They wouldn&#x27;t even tell him who he&#x27;d supposedly murdered.</p>
<p>The guard appeared at his cell.</p>
<p>&quot;Rivera. Your lawyer&#x27;s here.&quot;</p>
<p>Mateo looked up. &quot;I don&#x27;t have a lawyer. I don&#x27;t have money for a fucking lawyer.&quot;</p>
<p>The guard&#x27;s face didn&#x27;t change. &quot;We weren&#x27;t asking. Get up.&quot;</p>
<p>The visiting room was cold. Concrete walls. Metal table bolted to the floor. Two chairs</p>
<p>facing each other.</p>
<p>Mateo shuffled in. Chains on his wrists. Chains on his ankles.</p>
<p>He looked at the woman sitting across from him.</p>
<p>And his blood turned to ice.</p>
<p>&quot;What the FUCK?&quot;</p>
<p>Mira. The woman from the bar. The woman who&#x27;d taken him home. The woman who&#x27;d put</p>
<p>her fingers in his ass and made him cum so hard he saw God.</p>
<p>She was wearing a suit now. Expensive. Professional. A briefcase on the table in front of</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Mateo.&quot; Her voice was calm. Pleasant. Like they were meeting for coffee. &quot;Please.</p>` },

<p>watched him fall. And then he just --- disappeared. And everyone keeps telling me I didn&#x27;t</p>
<p>kill him. But somehow I&#x27;m still in here for MURDER.&quot;</p>
<p>His voice cracked on the last word.</p>
<p>&quot;I had a closed court hearing. No jury. No press. They charged me with murder and they</p>
<p>won&#x27;t even tell me who I fucking murdered!&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira folded her hands on the table.</p>
<p>&quot;Sit. Down.&quot;</p>
<p>Something in her voice made him obey. He sank into the chair across from her. Chains</p>
<p>rattling.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t murder anyone,&quot; he said. Quieter now. Desperate. &quot;I shot Hades Thorne. That&#x27;s it.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s all I did.&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira tilted her head. &quot;You didn&#x27;t murder someone? What are you talking about?&quot;</p>
<p>She reached into her briefcase. Pulled out a manila folder. Opened it.</p>
<p>Slid a photograph across the table.</p>

<p>And his whole world collapsed.</p>
<p>Danny.</p>
<p>His best friend. The guy whose couch he&#x27;d been crashing on. The guy who&#x27;d listened to him</p>
<p>rant about Sasha for weeks. The guy who&#x27;d been worried about him.</p>
<p>Dead.</p>
<p>Three bullet holes in his chest. Eyes open. Mouth slack. Blood everywhere.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you remember?&quot; Casimira&#x27;s voice was silk over steel. &quot;You shot him. Outside the</p>
<p>penthouse. Three bullets. Same gun you used on\\... who was it again? The man who doesn&#x27;t</p>
<p>exist?-- No.&quot; Mateo was shaking. Tears streaming down his face. &quot;No. When the fuck did Danny--- I</p>` },

<p>his chest came from your gun. The gun with your fingerprints. The gun you were holding</p>

<p>was never a Hades Thorne. There&#x27;s no record of him. No birth certificate. No social security</p>

<p>Mateo was sobbing now. Snot running down his face. Shoulders heaving.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t\\... I wouldn&#x27;t\\...&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira let him cry. Watched him break. Her face showed nothing.</p>
<p>Then she reached into her briefcase one more time.</p>
<p>Pulled out her phone.</p>
<p>&quot;One more thing.&quot;</p>
<p>She turned the screen toward him. Pressed play.</p>
<p>The video was dark. Grainy. Shot from a low angle.</p>
<p>But the subject was unmistakable.</p>
<p>Mateo. On his hands and knees. Face twisted in pleasure. And behind him --- a hand. A</p>
<p>woman&#x27;s hand. Two fingers buried deep in his ass.</p>
<p>The audio was clear. His moans. His gasps. The wet sounds of her fingers working in and</p>
<p>out of him. And then --- his orgasm. The way his whole body shook. The sound he made</p>
<p>when he came.</p>
<p>The face of the woman was pixelated. Blurred beyond recognition.</p>
<p>But his face was crystal clear.</p>` },
    { chapter: 15, title: ``, content: `<p>&quot;I just want you to know,&quot; Casimira said, setting the phone on the table, &quot;that this video has</p>
<p>somehow circulated around this prison. And a few others in the Chicago area.&quot;</p>

<p>pixels.</p>
<p>&quot;The person doing it is pixelated out. Privacy concerns, you understand.&quot; Casimira smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;But that&#x27;s definitely you. Bent over. Orgasming. From being fingered in the ass.&quot;</p>
<p>She stood up. Gathered her briefcase.</p>
<p>&quot;Good luck, Mateo.&quot;</p>
<p>She walked to the door. Knocked twice. The guard opened it.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait.&quot; Mateo&#x27;s voice was broken. Barely a whisper. &quot;Wait. Please. What happened to</p>
<p>Hades? Is he alive? Is Sasha okay? Please. I need to know. I need to understand what&#x27;s</p>

<p>Looked back at him over her shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Hades Thorne never existed,&quot; she said. &quot;Can&#x27;t kill someone who never existed.&quot;</p>
<p>She walked out.</p>
<p>The door closed behind her.</p>
<p>And Mateo sat alone in the visiting room, staring at a photo of his dead best friend, listening</p>
<p>to the echo of his own moans playing on repeat in his head.</p>
<p>He would spend the rest of his life in prison.</p>
<p>For a murder he didn&#x27;t commit.</p>
<p>Of a man he didn&#x27;t kill.</p>
<p>While the real monster walked free.</p>
<p>MIDWAY EXECUTIVE TERMINAL --- 5:47 AM</p>
<p>The private airfield was quiet at this hour. Dawn just starting to break. Orange light spilling</p>
<p>across the tarmac.</p>
<p>A Gulfstream G650 sat waiting. Engines warming. Steps down.</p>
<p>Casimira stood at the bottom of those steps. Checking her watch.</p>
<p>5:48.</p>
<p>5:49.</p>
<p>5:50.</p>
<p>A car appeared at the gate. Black sedan. Tinted windows.</p>
<p>It pulled up to the plane. Stopped.</p>
<p>The back door opened.</p>
<p>Sasha stepped out.</p>` },
    { chapter: 15, title: ``, content: `<p>She was wearing traveling clothes. Comfortable. Practical. A single bag over her shoulder.</p>
<p>She walked across the tarmac. Stopped in front of Casimira.</p>
<p>Neither of them spoke for a long moment.</p>
<p>Then Casimira&#x27;s whole face changed.</p>
<p>Not a smile. Something hungrier. Her nipples stiffened visibly through her silk blouse ---</p>
<p>two hard points pressing against the fabric.</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn&#x27;t sure you&#x27;d come.-- Neither was I.-- What changed your mind?&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha looked at the plane. At the sky turning gold. At the city she was leaving behind.</p>
<p>&quot;You were right,&quot; she said finally. &quot;About all of it. I can&#x27;t go back to normal. I can&#x27;t pretend to</p>
<p>be someone I&#x27;m not anymore. And I can&#x27;t spend the rest of my life waiting for someone to</p>
<p>fill a hole that can&#x27;t be filled.&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira&#x27;s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>&quot;So what do you want?&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha met her eyes. Held them.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to learn. Everything you know. Everything he knew. Everything I was too afraid to ask</p>
<p>for before.-- That&#x27;s a dangerous path.-- I know.-- There&#x27;s no going back.-- I know.&quot;</p>
<p>Casimira studied her for a long moment. Then her hand shot out --- fast, possessive --- and</p>
<p>grabbed a full handful of Sasha&#x27;s ass. Squeezed hard. Let her palm rest there like she</p>
<p>owned it.</p>
<p>&quot;All this ass.&quot; Her voice dropped. Appreciative. &quot;Girl, you built different. You know that?-- Girl, you loud as hell.-- You ain&#x27;t seen loud yet.&quot; Casimira gave her ass one more squeeze, then released it. &quot;We about to</p>
<p>have a BLAST.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha didn&#x27;t pull away. Didn&#x27;t flinch.</p>
<p>She thought about Hades. About what he would think. About whether this was betrayal.</p>
<p>But it didn&#x27;t feel like betrayal. This was a woman Hades had been with for sixteen years. A</p>` },

<p>Casimira followed close behind --- eyes fixed on the curve of Sasha&#x27;s hips, already</p>
<p>imagining everything that came next.</p>
